These are the three main areas of focus to gain points.</p> <p>Game flow Game is played over 3 rounds. The rounds are structured around a week, so we\u2019ll have 6 days of work and then a day of rest (the Sabbath). On each day of the week, each player will take a single turn. On the 7th day, we\u2019ll face the prophets judgement, feed our workers, and score points based on our efforts throughout the week. The game will end after the third Sabbath</p> <p>This game likes to call workers different things depending on where you place them. If I say a weird name it's probably a worker</p> <p>Player turn overview All of this is covered on your player aides. On your turn you will play a card to your board, and take one main action. Optionally you make take a single auxiliary action, use a trader, and use one elder. At the end of your turn you\u2019ll draw a card if possible.</p> <p>Card play details The first required action on your turn is to play a card to an available slot on your board. A slot can't have more than 2 cards in it. There is no benefit to covering cards early, so you should play to an open slot if you have one.</p> <p>Card anatomy  Cards have tags in the top left that are associated with the 3 main actions. At the bottom, they have a trade action that can be done as an auxiliary action on your turn. This can only be done on the turn that it isnplayed. The top right is a Sabbath scoring condition. that will only be active if the card is tucked. More on that later.</p> <p>How main actions work After playing a card for turn, you declare the main action that you will take. All the actions follow different rules, but this applies to all of them: Carrying out a main action required you to have banners of the corresponding color. You count up all the banners of that color, and that is effectively how much currency you have to spend on that action Banners can have a number, if no number, they're worth only 1. There are 4 places you can have banners available at the start of the action: Visible cards on board(not covered) Tucked cards (under player aide) Traders or elders used this turn Abilities on scroll tiles</p> <p>The main actions Red: Temples and Altars Placing Levites: Levites go in this area (point to worker tracks). When you take a red main action, you may place a levite in this area before or after the action is performed, but it is not mandatory. Levites fuel the red action, they\u2019re either used to allow you to place a resource in the temple or altar, or you can use them as additional banners. You can use multiple levites for banners, but they are removed from your pool of available levites to spend on the action.</p> <p>Temple: Levites can be used to place resources in the temple. The banner requirement to place on that level is shown to the left of the row. When placing resources here, resources are placed in the leftmost empty spot. To the top of the grid it shows VP awarded for delivering specified resources. You can\u2019t place cinders in the temple. To the right it shows your reward for placing a resource in a row, gained immediately. Temple is broken into 3 sectors, the bottom of the grid shows what happens whenever a sector is filled. Altar: Only wood or cinder can be placed here. The levites needed, and track progress gained is shown at the top of here. When moving on the track, you get all rewards you land on or move past with your movement. When breaking ties, a counter on the bottom of the stack is considered to be in the lead.</p> <p>Gray: Rubble, Walls, and Gates When taking action, you must select a single wall or gate space to focus on. If there is any rubble (resources) present, these must be cleared before a wall or gate can be built. It is possible to do this on the same turn.  Clearing rubble: Little hammer box section shows the number of required banners to remove the specified resource. Any rubble cleared is added to a player\u2019s supply of available resources. When clearing the last piece of rubble from a wall, you gain a blessing of the indicated color. Building walls and gates both require that there is no rubble, that you have the required amount of banners, and that you have the required resources. You can use 3 banners or one gold to get a discount of 1 resource when building. Walls: When building wall, draw 3 wall cards and place one of these over the wall space, gaining the effect shown on the card. No blessing reward, that is only for clearing rubble.Then place one of the unused wall cards on top of your deck, and the other on the bottom Gates: When building, grab the associated card from the side of the board and place it over the space. YOu gain any silver that was on the card. Take a worker from your supply and put it on here, it is now a gatekeeper and will remain here for the rest of the game. You then gain the printed immediate reward. Victory points shown on walls/gates are only earned at the end of the game Connecting walls and gates: After building, a wall or gate may form a connection between another wall or gate. Players involved will receive rewards. You gain the reward shown on the gate for connecting walls to it. If you own the gate and built the wall, you only get the reward once, but if another player is involved, they get the reward as well.</p> <p>Blue: Torah and Tenting around the city Torah When taking this action, players may teach the torah by placing a scribe on a chosen scroll tile, move their tent around the map of the city, or both (in either order). Teaching the torah gives you new passive abilities or bonus end game scoring opportunities. Banner and resource cost to place worker is shown to the left of the row. Each tile here can only hold 1 scribe. You can only place on the bottom row at first. Once this is done, the two adjacent tiles above are unlocked for placement. In addition to costs shown for the row, you must pay 1 silver to each player you\u2019re branching off of to reach the tile you place on. The first to place on the top row receives all of the food placed here during setup. At the end of the game each scribe will score points based on row, shown to the right Tenting: Banners and resources to perform different strength movements are shown here. You gain each reward you cross over, and we can share spaces. You must do all of your movement as a single action. You can only pick one selection, not perform multiple or double. Since you can do both of these actions you may be able to move your tent first to get the resources needed to drop a scribe (banners permitting)</p> <p>Auxillary actions (limit one per turn): Tradimg:  available on the bottom of played cards. Two types of trades, resources into silver or silver into resources. When trading silver for resources, that card will show a gate. Money is either payed to the owner of that gate if it is built, or if it not built it gets stacked on the card. this is only true for the first coin, any other coins paid go to the bank Flip development tile Pay the cost on the top left, them gain the green banner. Any workers already placed on the card will not move after it is flipped. No benefits are gained from workers retroactively Using a trader and/or elder: In addition to your main action you can use a trader and/or an elder. You may only use one of each To do this, you place one worker on your player board in the appropriate slot. Green is trader, orange is merchant. The bonus gained from them will be shown on that slot to the right. These workers will return after the Sabbath ready to be used as any type of worker in the next round Blessings (the jars) Go up specified track, wild you get to pick. When you get at least </p> <p>Recap: Mandatory (in order): Play a card Take a main action Draw a card (if able) Optional: Auxillary action (1x) Trader/elder</p> <p>Sabbath (prep) We\u2019ve talked about how turns work, this will continue in the same turn order from the first player market until we've each had 6 turns. You can tell bc you'll have no legal card placements left on your board. After the 6th turn is done, we\u2019ll prep for Sabbath. This phase is resolved by everyone simultaneously. You may use farmers and laborers, and must resolve the prophet\u2019s judgement.  There may also be other effects that players have activate. You may resolve all of these elements in whatever order you like Farmers/Laborers:  If players have any workers left in their supply, they must assign them as farmers or laborers. Farmers are yellow worker spots w/ the food background, laborers are purple worker sports w/ the hammer. Both of these will immediately produce the printed resources, with laborers having a choice of 2 options.  Prophet\u2019s Judgement: We look at the altar card and resolve it\u2019s effect based on where our flamer marker is on the altar track in relation to the prophets. 3 zones, behind, inbetween, and ahead of. The prophets will move after each sabbath, so you need to keep advancing on the track in order to get the good bonuses</p> <p>Sabbath (phase)</p>"},{"location":"big_games/feast_for_odin/","title":"Overview","text":"<p>This is a worker placement and tile laying game where we are clans of vikings stiving to be the best.

The flow of the game is working down the trail to get up to the top to sell your cattle at market. Over the course of a game, you can expect to sell cattle 5-7 times.</p> <p>Overview Set up player boards: We're going to block off all these spaces with disks in our player colors. These are all upgrades that we\u2019ll be able to unlock over the course of the game, but we\u2019ll get back to that. Brief overview of board. Talk about buildings, outlaws, and hazards. Kansas City, start of trail This game has deck builder elements where you'll be using the cards in your hand to do stuff. Cows have breeding values in the top corner that will be important later.</p> <p>Turn structure: On your turn you'll do 3 things. Move, take actions in the space you land in, and then draw up to your handsize. There are spaces on your player hard to remind you of how these work Movement: Your base movement is 3, but you can increase that by getting these 2 upgrades. You must always move forward at least 1 space, and you can never go backwards. It takes one movement point per location you move across. Locations are tiles, any empty building site does not require movement to cross. You can share spaces, and Kansas City stops all movement, you can't move past it with extra movement. The space where you end up is the one you activate during the next part of your turn</p> <p>Green and black hands: These are shown on tiles you move over and indicate fees that you have to pay. Green is one, black is two. Hazard or outlaw tiles get paid to the bank, player tile fees get paid to that player.</p> <p>Not being able to pay does not stop your movement. Pay what you can, if anything, and keep moving. Never have to pay retroactivly. So if you land on a space you can't pay for but then earn money, you don't have to then pay the fee you missed</p> <p>Activating the tile you landed on: If it's neutral or yours, activate either all location actions (actions on tile), or one auxillary action.</p> <p>Local actions can be done in any order, you don't have to do them all. Some have a cost, some have a slash for either/or, most have 1-3 options</p> <p>Auxillary actions are shown on the side of your board. You have a couple unlocked by default, the rest can be made available by upgrades</p> <p>If you land on a hazard, outlaw, or tile owned by another player, you can only take one auxillary action.</p> <p>So you want to try and stop on neutral buildings or ones you own to get the most out of your turn</p> <p>There is one space you can end your turn on that we haven't talked about, Kansas City. This is where you send your cattle to market.</p> <p>When you reach Kansas City, you must carry out the 5 steps in order. Move your dude from each space to the next as you complete them</p> <p>Phase 1-3: Foresights: pick a tile and place it. Hazards and outlaws go in the next lowest numbered space in the appropriate area. </p> <p>Workers get placed in their area following a few rules. Must be placed in the row with the job market token left to right. When the job market token would be covered move it down. This is the timer, when it reaches the end, the end of the game is triggered. Additionally when it reaches the halfway point, the cattle market is refilled.</p> <p>Phase 4: income: Reveal your whole hand. Calculate your total breeding value by adding up the values from every unique cow in your hand. Duplicates will not be counted. Then discard all cards from your hand</p> <p>You can increase your breeding value by using certificates. There are temporary certificates that you have a tracker for on your board, or permanent ones that you unlock through upgrading</p> <p>Phase 5 - Deliver: you must now pick a city to deliver to based on your total breeding value (equal or lower). Can't deliver to a city with your disk on it, with the exception of Kansas City and New York. Both of these are worth negative points so not a great idea to do a lot. Once you pick a city, select a disk from your board to place. Keep in mind the color space you take the disk from must match the color City you deliver to (black or white). You will then gain any bonuses shown on the tile, and may gain or lose points at the end of the game  Bonuses in green arrows aren't triggered unless you have a disk in both locations Lastly, check to see if you need to pay transport costs. If your train is directly at the city or further up the track, it's free. If your train is further back, pay 1 for each crossing symbol between you and the destination city Move your herder to the start of the trail horse space Refill the forsight spaces from the appropriate bags</p>"},{"location":"big_games/guards_of_atlantis_2/","title":"Guards of atlantis 2","text":""},{"location":"big_games/guards_of_atlantis_2/#overview","title":"Overview","text":"<p>This is basically League of Legends the board game.

Gray is wild, but a group can not be made up of only gray. Red (Influence) track: number of cards you can add to your palace during income, also rewards coins, cards, and palace placements Yellow (cultural) track: the power of your unique power and also gives goods and build action points.  Blue (population) track: Weapon income and the number of VP you gain during scoring for warriors on the map. Also provides weapons and adds warriors to your reserves.

Once your action is resolved, you will remove the die pants from the action space, and then the next player in turn order will resolve the action of their hightest die. We will repeat this process until all actions are resolved.</p> <p>After taking your die, but before resolving any acitons, you may instead forfeit the action to gain 2 coins.</p> <p>Every action that you take could potentially trigger additional benefits from your royal traits. This is the crown symbol of cards tucked under your board. We start with one from set up. Royal traits can still be triggered even if you forfeit the action.</p> <p>The Actions: Prepare (red eyeball) This action allows you to gain new cards. Each action point on the space you activate allows you to either draw one card from either the offer row or the top of the deck. The offer row does not refill until the end of your turn. There is no hand limit. </p> <p>Develop (blue tablet): This action allows you to play cards. With each action point from the space you activate, you may play one card. If you have enough action points to play multiple cards, you must fully resolve a card before playing the next. Played cards are not discarded, keep them in your player area.     Card anatomy Coin cost to play the card is in the top left A good is shown under the cost. You get a 3 coin discount if you have at least one of the depicted good. This does not stack for multiple goods. There are two types of goods. Permanent, which are the larger tiles, and temporary, which are the smaller tokens. If you use a temporary good to pay for a card discount, you lose the good afterwards. Permanent are permanent. If two different goods are shown you can get one or both discounts. If two of the same good are shown, you must have 2 of that good to get the 6 coin discount. Top right of the card is VP. You only get this amount of VP if the card is tucked in your palace at the end of the game. Otherwise played cards are worth 1 VP for endgame scoring. The large portion of the card depicts the instant effect when played. The bottom of the card with the crown symbol in the banner is the royal trait. This is the passive bonus you will get if the card is tucked in your palace</p> <p>Build (yellow hammer): This action allows you to place cities, towers, and farms on the map, as well as build and advance ships on the trade routes. While goods only get you a one time discount when playing cards, when taking build actions you get discounts PER good. Each action point can be spend to do any of the following: Build a city: Select a region w/ no other city that has at least one of your warriors. Pay the city\u2019s printed cost, getting a discount of 3 silver for each brick. Place your leftmost available city on to the foundation tile in the region. Build a tower: Select a region w/ one of your cities that doesnot already have a tower. Pay printed cost, discounts by red. Place leftmost tower on the map next to your city then gain the uncovered bonus from your player board. Build a farm: Select a region with no farm and at least one of your warriors. If this is the 1st farm built, return one warrior from this region to your reserves, 2 for 2nd and so on. For each yellow resource you have, you may return one fewer warrior. Place top leftomost farm and gain uncovered bonus. Build a ship: To do this, you must have at least one more city than you currently have ships. Since you start with one city, you may always build your first ship. Building a ship consists of 2 steps: Pay depicted cost discounted by wood Sleect a trade route without one of your ships, then place your leftmost ship on the lowest space, paying the depicted cost (discounted by green). If you cannot pay the cost of the trade route space the ship would go in, you cannot build the ship. Advance ship: To do this, you must already have a ship on a trade route, and must be able to pay the printed cost of the space you\u2019re moving to. For each green resource you have you get a discount of 1 coin. Whenever you get to the second space of a trade route, choose and take one of the available trade route bonus tiles. 4th space gives you a red bonus tile, 5th space gains you the VP shown.</p> <p>Expand (green dude): Allows you to place warriors in regions you have cities, and to move your warriors on the map. Each action point allows you to do the following: Place one warrior from your reserves into any region containing one of your cities Move one warrior from one region to an adjacent region.</p> <p>Wild (multicolor snake): You can use wild actions as any other action in the game. You can never split wild action points into two different main actions. Royal traits for other actions besides wild are not triggered by you taking the wild action. Ex: If you choose to build w/ your wild action, you do not trigger the build action royal traits you have.</p> <p>Royal Traits: Will either be triggered when taking the depicted action, or when retrieving the depicted die. Any traits triggered must be done before, between, or after actions. Each effect must be performed in it\u2019s entirety before moving to the next.</p> <p>Extra actions: You may use each of the extra actions at most once during your turn Spend a weapon to ove a warrior to an adjacent region Spend a weapon to gain a temporary good of the same type as depicted in a region where you have a warrior Use a trade bonus tile, gaining all benefits then returning it to the box Discard cards for an equal amount of coins Exchange 3 temporary goods for a matching permanent good. If there is no permanent good in the face up stacks on the main board, you cannot exchange temp goods for that type of good. Gaining goods bonuses. When permanent goods are gained, they can gain you income track steps.  First good of a type is one step 2nd good of a type is 2 stps 3rd good is 1 step, and top card of 2nd age deck 4th good is 2 steps, no further bonuses Battle \u201csea peoples\u201d in a region where you have at least one warrior. Spend as much weaponry as shown on the top sea peoples tile, return one warrior from that region to your reserves, and gain the depicted benefit. Then place the sea peoples tile next to your board. </p> <p>Objectives (vases): As soon as you meet the condition on a vase tile, place one of your objective markers to cover the space depicting the highest VP and gain that VP. No one else may place on that space. If two people meet the condition at the same time, they both gain the VP w/ both players putting their markers on different spaces.</p> <p>Scoring: Scoring occurs after the 2nd and 4th rounds. After the mid game scoring we will also witch to a new deck of cards. Here is what we\u2019ll score: Farms: 2/4/8/14 VP for 1/2/3/4 farms placed Region: Score in numerical order. Check both of these: Dominance: most warriors Prescense: At least 1 warrior, but not majority According to their position on the blue (population track), players score the right bonus for dominance, and the left for presence. If players are tied for dominance, they only score presence. Additional towers built may grant extra VP for dominance. Only in the 4th round will we score the following: Sea peoples battles: Remove all remaining lvl 1 sea peoples tiles from the map. For every tile remainiung on the map from lowest to highest region number, the player w/ the most warriors in that region may choose to battle those ea people. If there is a ttie the player w/ the most weaponry wins the tie. If most warriors chooses not toi battle, the next player can choose to and so on. Resource scoring: add up remaining coins, weapons, cards in hand, divide by 5 for VP Palace: # of VP on tucked palace cards VP below city and ships built</p>"},{"location":"big_games/rajas/","title":"Rajas of the Ganges","text":""},{"location":"big_games/rajas/#overview","title":"Overview","text":"<p>We play venerable soverigns trading goods and developing our estates to balance our growth in prestige and prosperity</p> <p>This is worker placement game where we will be using dice to pay the cost for actions.

The famous magician Dhaalgard is retiring, and we have 5 weeks to prove to him that we\u2019re the best magician around and most worthy to inherit his secrets, including the trickerion stone, rumored to give Dhaalgard supernatural powers</p> <p>At it\u2019s core, this is a worker placement game</p> <p>Over the course of the game, you\u2019ll:</p> <p>Buy tricks (Yellow downtown) Buy the stuff we need to perform them (Orange market row) Practice the tricks (Red workshop) Stage them in the theater (Theater), and then perform them for fame points</p> <p>At the end of the 5th week (round), whoever has the most fame wins</p> <p>There are 4 different categories of illusions in Trickerion Mechanical (gear) Spiritual (swirl) Escape (chain) Optical (eye)</p> <p>We\u2019ll start the game by picking a magician that prefers tricks of one of these schools</p> <p>Start of the week At the start of every week, we\u2019ll roll these 6 dice and place them on the square spaces in the Downtown (Yellow) area Starting with the second week, we\u2019ll rearrange the turn order track so whoever has the least fame is first, most is last You can then advertise, to gain 2 fame. You place your poster on the turn order slot you occupy, paying the cost</p> <p>Placing workers:  You have a minimum of 3 character discs that are workers you can place in 4 different places around the main board. Downtown: Where you get new workers, money, and tricks Market Row: Where you buy materials to practice tricks Workshop (your playerboard): Where you actually practice your tricks Theater: where you stage (heh) and perform your tricks</p> <p>Each character disk has a half circle on the bottom w/ a value and lightning bolt Biggest number is you, the magician Next biggest is your specialist Smallest is your apprentice</p> <p>The board has circular areas where you can place your character discs. Each space has a small number below it, which represent action points. The more action points, the more stuff you get to do Action points are cumulative, so placing your magician disk (the 3) on top of a spot with a 2, means you get 5 action points to spend in that space</p> <p>Action programming To decide where your characters will go, you have to set them in advance You do this by placing an assignment card face down below each character disk This process is down simultaenously (and since they\u2019re played face down, secrectly) Everyone will flip and reveal A character without a disk will not get placed In turn order, we will take turns placing one character out onto the board into their pre-designated spot until everyone has placed all of their character Using characters like this will cost you wages at the end of the round If you do not think you can pay (or for any other reason) you can treat a character as idle and just flip over their assignment card instead of placing them They will not be activated this turn, but you will not have to pay them</p> <p>BACK TO THE ACTION LOCATIONS Downtown (Where you get new workers, money, and tricks) Learn a trick (top middle): 3 action points Grab a trick card if it\u2019s category matches one of the die faces You can also grab a trick of your magician\u2019s preferred category So if a trick category is not your preferred type, or not shown on one of the die, it cannot be selected Cards have a fame threshold in the bottom right, which you must meet to be able to learn a trick. This value will either be 1 or 16 You must have at least this many fame points to learn a trick, but if you fall short, you can pay the difference in coins You DO NOT have to pick the card off the top of the pile. You can dig through that deck and grab whatever trick you want If you grab a trick that matches a die face, you then flip the die to it\u2019s X side If you grab a tick that matches your preferred category but not one of the die, you choose which die to flip to the x side The trick goes into your workshop, and you assign one of your symbol markers to it (the solid card suit token w/ no magic category symbols). If you are out of slots in your workshop, you can always remove a trick from there. You then remove all associated tiles and return the trick to the downtown board Hire another characte (top left)r: 3 action points Available characters are shown on the dice Just like getting a new trick, if you get a new character, flip the corresponding die to it\u2019s x face Place the new character disk on top of the one that you used to buy it so you don\u2019t get mixed up with it on your player board You can only hire one of each specialist Withdraw money from bank (top right): 3 action points Choose the amount you want, gain it, then flip the die to it\u2019s X face Reroll die (bottom right): 1 action point Reroll any one die in this area Set die (bottom left): 2 action points: Set a die to whatever face you want in this seciton Market Row (Where you buy materials to practice tricks) Trick require materials to perform them (show cost on a trick) Buy material (furthest left): 1 action point Choose an available component, and buy up to 3 instances of them Materials have a dot on the bottom (and all share a color) for how many coins each material is. One dot equals one coin each, three dots equals 3 coins each The board basically represents the catalog of available goods. When you buy components, they are not removed from the board, but gained directly from the supply You can only own up to 3 of each type of component. They\u2019re stored on your board and stacked by type When you buy, you can spend extra action points to bargain the price down. This is attached to the same ation space and costs 1 action point. This does not decrease the price per unit, only the overall price Can\u2019t bargain down to zero, will always pay at least one coin Slow order for the market (far right): 1 action point Goods queued up with this action will appear in the store next week Place the new component on the board. The slot it is placed in is the component it will replace when it arrives in the shop Quick order for the market (middle): 2 action points Goods selected with this action will be available for immediate purchase Place the new component in the single slot, replacing one already there if applicable The component is now available to purchase this week Items in the quick order slot cost an extra coin per unit to purchase The quick order slot gets cleared out at the end of the week Workshop (your player board) (Where you actually practice your tricks) Preparing a trick When you place a disk here, if you own all the components a trick requires (and in the right quantities), you can then prep the trick. You spend the action points shown on the trick, then populate the trick with the trick marker tiles equal to the number shown on the trick (matching the suit of the symbol marker placed whenever the trick was originally gained). If there are already markers on a trick, you can\u2019t prep it With the setup for the beginner game, our starting trick is already prepped When a trick is prepped, it just checks to see that you have the components, they are NOT consumed Specialists (your side board) These are chosen during set up, beginner game setup has assigned us all one Each specialist has a unique action you can take (they are conveniently not named on the cards) Engineer (wrench) Allows you to move a trick from your board to hers for 1 action point (or exchange tricks already in her slot) If you prep a trick on her board, you get one bonus trick marker Manager (stopwatch) Allows you to move components to his card, or swap them with components on your board Components here are treated as having a bonus one for free. So if there are 2 glass on him, it counts as 3 glass. So if this is the case you couldn\u2019t buy more glass, because the component limit is 3 Assistant (bow) Extra slot for an apprentice (another character/worker) In any of the 3 major locations we\u2019ve talked about, Downtown, the Market row, and the workshop, you can spend one trickerion shard when you place your character for an extra action point. You can not do this in the\u2026 Theater (where you stage (heh) and perform your tricks The theater represents various different theaters, think of it as one of many buildings that you can perform magic Placement circles are grouped in column by day (listed at the bottom of the row) If you place a character in a certain day\u2019s slot, you have locked that day down, and no other player can place a character in that column for the rest of that week Any other characters you place in the theater have to be placed into the column you\u2019ve already placed in, so no double dipping Again, you can\u2019t spend trickerion shards here for action action points like in the other locations Top hot slots are for placing magicians only Staging a trick so that it\u2019s ready to perform (top left): 1 action point You spend one action point to move a trick token from your workshop to one of the performance cards Think of these cards as playbills that list the various trick that will be performed in a single show Each trick you stange on a card must be unique, so you could not have multiple of the same trick token (because these would be from the same trick) When you place the token, the corner representing that trick\u2019s category of magic must be touching one of the circles on the card If you stage a trick so that the symbol inside the circle lines up with another trick, those tricks are now linked This gets your extra fame or coins (left reminder card) depending on the level of the trick If there is a trickerion shard in the circle where this occurred, any player with a trick token in there gets one shard. If both tricks are yours you still only get one shard Reschedule action (top right): one action point Lets you move an already placed trick token to an empty space on a card (either the same card or a different one) If you link tricks while doing this, they don\u2019t count for any bonuses we just talked about Magician only performance slots (time to put on a show): New phase that happens after all characters have been placed and all turns are over Turn order is ignored for resolution of this phase, we go left to right by day in the theater columns A player gets to choose a performance card that has at least one of their trick markerst on it to perform and performs that show Every trick on the card will be performed, whether it belongs to you or another player Players will earn the fame and coins from their corresponding tricks in that show Yield modifiers Some days are better or worse to place on.  Thursday has a negative modifier of minus one coin and minus one fame If you place any worker in the Thursday column, and any of your tricks get performed in shows at any time that week, you receive the negative modifier for any rewards of those tricks. You can\u2019t go into the negative Conversley, Sunday gives you a positive modifier for any of your tricks performed on any day So thursday gives you bonus action points, but a worse yield modifier, where Sunday gives you less action points, but a better yield modifier. Friday and Saturday both give no bonus to action points or yield modifier. If your trick gets performed, but you have no characters in the theater, your yield modifier is the same as the performing magicians Performing magician bonuses Why perform the show if everyone\u2019s tricks get payed out you ask? The right reminder card shows the bonuses the performing magician gets 1 fame for every trick link in the show The reward shown if you have that additional character \u201cbackstage\u201d in that column Whatever bonus is listed at the bottom of the performance card When a trick is performed, the marker is removed from the card and returned from the player\u2019s supply, NOT back to the trick card</p> <p>ROUND END Wages When the weeks performances have ended, you need to pay wages The slot for that token on your board shows what you have to pay (if you used that character this round) If you can\u2019t pay, you lose 2 fame for each coin you can\u2019t pay in wages You have to pay if you can Clean up  Take character disks back from the main board If anyone was hired, add them to your board Any goods in the ordered area of market row replace the appropriate goods Any quick ordered goods are removed Performance cards move forward like a conveyer belt, and a new one is flipped from the deck into the empty slot A performance card is removed from the game when it falls off the conveyor belt, and any trick tokens still on it are returned to the players supply Everyone who advertised gets their poster back Round counter advances Reroll and place dice Take your assignment cards back Time for another week</p> <p>END GAME 1 fame for each leftover shard 1 fame for every 3 coins 2 fame for each apprentice 3 fame for each specialist Initiative order breaks ties</p>"},{"location":"big_games/unconcious_mind/","title":"Unconcious mind","text":"<p>We are members of a psychological society started by Sigmund Freud devoted to psychoanalysis (or study of the unconscious mind). </p> <p>As members of this society, we aim to come up with new therapeutic techniques, grow our clientele, and become Freud\u2019s most distinguished contemporary. To do this we will discuss ideas with peers, compile notes, and publish theory. To do all this we\u2019ll also need a lot of coffee</p> <p>Overview: The game is played over a number of rounds. On your turn, you will chose from one of 3 options: State Ideas Recall Ideas Treat Clients Play will continue like this until Freud\u2019s reputation marker (the gray heart looking thing) moves onto the watch space of the reputation track, triggering the end of the  game. Once this happens, we will finish out the current round, and then play one more round. At the end of that, the player with the most victory points wins the game</p> <p>GENERAL CONCEPTS  INSIGHT: Each player has a big ol 3 color wheel. This is where you will keep track of your insight. There are 3 colored wedges for each quality, and Three rings, one for each level: Minor - diamond shaped Median - hex shaped Major - circle shaped</p> <p>There is also a center reserve, which you will draw new insight from. While in the reserve, insight does not have a quality or level. You start with white insights in your pool, but can unlock playered colored ones throughout the game</p> <p>Certain effects allow you to generate an insight. To generate insight, move them from your reserve to the corresponding areas. If you would generate insight, but do not have any in your reserve, you may choose to remove one from anywhere on your dial and use that one instead.</p> <p>Certain effects that look like arrows will let you move insight. Whe you increase level you can\u2019t go from 0 to 1. </p> <p>You pay insight by moving it to your reserve. You may always use a higher level insight to pay a lower level cost, but there is no \u201cmaking change\u201d. So you could pay a minor cost with a median insight of the same color.</p> <p>There are generic colorless insight shapes that refer to any insight of the depicted level. There is a spot on your playerboard where you can trade a minor, median, and major insight for a heart shaped box.</p> <p>GENERAL CONCEPT: REPUTATION: On the city board is a reputation track that does two different things. Any time a player one goes up, so does Freud\u2019s. Him reaching the pocketwatch triggers the end of the game. Finish out round + one more.</p> <p>When you gen a reputation (looks like a medal), first move Freud\u2019s marker and then yours. If any marker crosses a line with the little face on the track, this make\u2019s Freud\u2019s meeple move locations, and this can happen multiple times in a turn.</p> <p>This icon triggers the reputation track. When this happens you score points/coffee show at the zone above the track in the section where your marker is.Then look at the zone below the track. You can perform any one action from Freud\u2019s section or lower.</p> <p>Just remember, gaining reputation and triggering the reputation track are different things.</p> <p>GENERAL CONCEPT</p> <p>Two major resources on playerboard. Heart shaped boxes are mainly used to cure clients. Conversions in middle of board. Coffee is used for a lot, there are conversions in the bottom left of the playerboard. When you would downgrade and insight, you can pay a coffee to ignore it. You can pay 2 coffee to level up an insight or change it\u2019s color. Coffee can also be used to gain a bright idea token, which we\u2019ll talk about more.</p> <p>MAJOR ACTIONS On your turn, you can do one of three actions. Here\u2019s how to </p> <p>STATE IDEAS Ideas are the little speech bubbles in the bottom left of your playerboard. To perform this action you will grab 1 or 2 ideas and place them onto an empty idea space on the meeting table, pointing the tail at the action you want to perform. Placing one idea lets you do the action once, 2 ideas lets you do it twice. You can\u2019t point the tails at an action that you have other ideas pointing at already.</p> <p>You can substitute a bright idea for an idea token. You could even use 2 bright ideas and no idea token. These will go back to the supply at end of turn, where normal ideas stay on the meeting table. After performing your actions, you advance your inkpot</p> <p>INKPOT Your inkpot will move clockwise along it\u2019s track equal to the value shown on the row of the meeting board where you took your action, performing the inkpot effect where it ends movement. Bottom left of playerboard reminds you that for each bright idea token spent, you can modify this moevent +/- 1, down to a minimum of one. Three spaces aligned with insight will generate the insight shown, and then resolve the effects of every notebook tile in that row in any order. If the token has been removed from the end of the row, you will get the effect shown there too. Space on the left activates reputation track (not gain rep) Top space of the 4 stack has you pick a column with no idea above it, and then resolve every notebook tile in that column. If the token has been removed from below the column, get the effect show there as well. When you move your inkpot over the printed gain idea symbol, remove the leftmost idea token and add it to your reserve</p> <p>MEETING TABLE ACTIONS</p> <p>Right lets you generate one minor insight of each quality Left lets you perform 2 elevations and one transfer (in any order)</p> <p>These 3 all let you pay coffee to grab a notebook tile Left: Grab the tile from above column Mid: Grab the tile from above column and activate the banner effect Right: Grab the tile from above column, activate the banner effect, activate main effect Tiles get placed into leftmost empty space of any row on your playerboard (place so that banner side is facedown) Third tile in each row has a cured client requirement. First symbol requires 0, second symbol 1, and last symbol 2. Tiles slide down to fill. This happens immediately. So if you took the action twice you\u2019ll always have a full tileset available. When a row is completed , remove the insight and add it to the reserve on your tile. Same for a column.</p> <p>Right: Draw the top card of the research deck. Then you may swap any card in your hand with one of the faceup research cards in the display Left: Play up to two research cards or publish a treatise Cards stay in front of you after resolved, location tags on them are added to your overall tag count Treatise:  To do this you must have a player colored insight on your dial All of the treatises in the display are available, pick one to publish</p> <p>You can use your own research cards and cite other players research cards to supply all the needed color cards, but the leftmost card with the icon must come from your played cards. You will lose access to any tags on cards that come from your played cards. Once all cards are gathered, arrange them in the correct order and place the tile over them. Remove a player colored insight from your dial, placing it on the tile. Score the points in the center. Location tags on the tile are now yours. To cite research from another player, grab the rightmost card from one of their treatises and add it to the cards you're collecting for the treatise. They receive 2 points and a bright idea. Can take multiple cards from the same player, and can take from multiple players, but you can only take the rightmost card, not leaving any gaps.</p> <p>These actions let you move around the city. Lets talk about the city first. City is divided into 3 districts. 2 locations in each district, identified by tags. Each location may hold any number of figures</p> <p>3 possible location effects, applied when you move to that location Each location has 3 bonus slots Each district has 4 bonus slots</p> <p>Left action: Move your professor up to 2 locations clockwise around city, or move them to the same location as Freud. If you choose the latter, you must start in a different location that Freud. Right action: Move Freud up to 3 spaces clockwise. After moving yourself or Freud, you will resolve the effect of the location where that figure ends up to a maximum of 5 times. To determine this, either count: Number of figures in that location Number of that location\u2019s tags you have There is a reminder in the middle of the board that you can spend a bright idea to get 2 extra actions here, but whatever combination you pay, the max is still 5.</p> <p>RECALL IDEAS Instead of placing ideas and taking actions, you can recall your ideas. You must have 1 idea on the meeting table to do this Count the number of meeting table spaces you have ideas on and gain that amount of coffee. Remove all your ideas from the table and place them back in your supply. Then choose either the location with your professor or the location with Freud. You will then claim a location bonus or a district bonus. Location bonus: Choose an empty location bonus slot and gain that effect. Then move the topmost token from that district\u2019s color stack and place it on the option that you chose to cover it. Placing the token with the reputation icon earns you a reputation. District bonus: To do this you must have a player colored insight on your dial. Count the number of location tags matching the color of the district. Place your player colored insight marker on the number equal to or lesser than that value, gaining the bonus shown. Then move the topmost token from the district onto that slot. Once a district is out of tokens, no location or district bonuses can be taken there.</p> <p>TREAT CLIENTS</p> <p>This is your office where clients and dreams will go. Dreams up top, clients on bottom. When you treat a client, you may treat one or both in any order. To treat a client,  look at the effect of the topmost dream. You must pay the depicted insight. Resolve the effect of the dream. Heart symbols are therapy points For each therapy point, move the marker on that side of the office one space to the left If you move over this space, immediately trigger catharsis. Catharsis will remove the client\u2019s grief layer, but more on that in a minute Dream card is then removed from the game. When gaining therapy points, if you hit 0, you have cured the client, more on that later. If you would gain \u201cextra\u201d therapy points pushing you into the negative, you gain that many heart shaped boxes. Some manifest dreams have a symbol in the top right. If that symbol matches the one of the client\u2019s grief layer, you will gain a heart shaped box when resolving that dream.</p> <p>CATHARSIS: Resolve the bonus on the top left of the grief layer card. Starting grief layer cards also show the grad cap symbol. Removing this grief layer unlocks your second office room. Removing the grief layer unlocks the abilities on the bottom of the card. Even though the client is not yet cured, this ability is now active. Points are only scored when client is cured.</p> <p>When a client is cured, you move them to your tableau. Their ability and tags are still active. Routine clients provide passive bonus and tags Case study clients provide end game scoring All of these are explained on one of your player aides. If there are still any dream cards in your office when a client is cured, remove them. From the game.</p> <p>END OF TURN You may use heart shaped boxes to produce therapy points This can trigger catharsis or cure a client Take on a new client for each empty office room you have Take one of the patients from the display and add it to an office. Display is refilled immediately.  Draw a latent dream and put it in space above the client\u2019s room Draw a manifest dream from the display or the top card of the deck. This display is refilled immediately. Place it on top of the latent dream. Place the therapy marker on the space matching the amount of green hearts shown on the card</p> <p>LOCATION GOALS 7 location goal tiles are between the main boards When you meet the condition shown on a tile, you must immediately claim it Gain the reputation, then place the tile face down in your tableau. Tags are now yours.</p> <p>END OF GAME When Freud\u2019s marker reaches pocketwatch, end of game is triggered. Player who caused this to happen gains 3 points.  Complete the current round, then one additional round.  In final round, you do not take on any new clients</p> <p>POINTS Score points shown on reputation marker space (shown on end of reputation track): Player who is furthest along the track scores 2 points for each of their completed treatises, and 2 points for each cured client. 2nd farthest on track gets 1 point for each. In case of a tie, the player on bottom is considered further ahead. Check number of districts with your colored insights. Score 4/10/18 points for presence in 1/2/3 districts (shown in middle of board). Count number of rows on playerboard that are full of notebook tiles. Score 1/5/6 points for 1/2/3 being completed. (shown on player board top right) Score points for unique location tags you have (shown on bottom of board) Case study cards Heart shaped boxes convert to 2 points each Coffee converts to bright ideas 3:1 1 point for each bright idea</p>"},{"location":"big_games/unconcious_mind_template/","title":"Unconcious Mind","text":""},{"location":"big_games/unconcious_mind_template/#overview","title":"Overview","text":"<p>Note</p> <p>We are members of a psychological society started by Sigmund Freud devoted to psychoanalysis (or study of the unconscious mind). </p> <p>As members of this society, we aim to come up with new therapeutic techniques, grow our clientele, and become Freud\u2019s most distinguished contemporary.
