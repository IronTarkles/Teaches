## Overview

We're using the power of steam to revolutionize our city and get away from our reliance on animals for labor. Who cares if we have to tear down trees and clog up rivers, there are plenty to go around. Myths shouldn't stand in the way of progress

The game is played in turns with no rounds or phases. On your turn you will either take a production turn or a city turn. At the end of your turn, you're see if you have any conflicts with the Yokai. After that it moves on to the next players turn.
