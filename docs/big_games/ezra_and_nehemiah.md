Ezra and Nehemiah teach

Plot
We're working to rebuild the city by building the temple, rebuilding the city walls and gates, and teaching the Torah to the people of the city. These are the three main areas of focus to gain points.

Game flow
Game is played over 3 rounds. The rounds are structured around a week, so we’ll have 6 days of work and then a day of rest (the Sabbath). On each day of the week, each player will take a single turn. On the 7th day, we’ll face the prophets judgement, feed our workers, and score points based on our efforts throughout the week. The game will end after the third Sabbath

This game likes to call workers different things depending on where you place them. If I say a weird name it's probably a worker

Player turn overview
All of this is covered on your player aides. On your turn you will play a card to your board, and take one main action. Optionally you make take a single auxiliary action, use a trader, and use one elder. At the end of your turn you’ll draw a card if possible.

Card play details
The first required action on your turn is to play a card to an available slot on your board. A slot can't have more than 2 cards in it. There is no benefit to covering cards early, so you should play to an open slot if you have one.

Card anatomy 
Cards have tags in the top left that are associated with the 3 main actions. At the bottom, they have a trade action that can be done as an auxiliary action on your turn. This can only be done on the turn that it isnplayed. The top right is a Sabbath scoring condition. that will only be active if the card is tucked. More on that later.

How main actions work
After playing a card for turn, you declare the main action that you will take. All the actions follow different rules, but this applies to all of them:
Carrying out a main action required you to have banners of the corresponding color.
You count up all the banners of that color, and that is effectively how much currency you have to spend on that action
Banners can have a number, if no number, they're worth only 1.
There are 4 places you can have banners available at the start of the action:
Visible cards on board(not covered)
Tucked cards (under player aide)
Traders or elders used this turn
Abilities on scroll tiles

The main actions
Red: Temples and Altars
Placing Levites:
Levites go in this area (point to worker tracks). When you take a red main action, you may place a levite in this area before or after the action is performed, but it is not mandatory. Levites fuel the red action, they’re either used to allow you to place a resource in the temple or altar, or you can use them as additional banners. You can use multiple levites for banners, but they are removed from your pool of available levites to spend on the action.

Temple:
Levites can be used to place resources in the temple. The banner requirement to place on that level is shown to the left of the row. When placing resources here, resources are placed in the leftmost empty spot. To the top of the grid it shows VP awarded for delivering specified resources. You can’t place cinders in the temple. To the right it shows your reward for placing a resource in a row, gained immediately. Temple is broken into 3 sectors, the bottom of the grid shows what happens whenever a sector is filled.
Altar:
Only wood or cinder can be placed here. The levites needed, and track progress gained is shown at the top of here. When moving on the track, you get all rewards you land on or move past with your movement. When breaking ties, a counter on the bottom of the stack is considered to be in the lead.

Gray: Rubble, Walls, and Gates
When taking action, you must select a single wall or gate space to focus on. If there is any rubble (resources) present, these must be cleared before a wall or gate can be built. It is possible to do this on the same turn. 
Clearing rubble:
Little hammer box section shows the number of required banners to remove the specified resource. Any rubble cleared is added to a player’s supply of available resources. When clearing the last piece of rubble from a wall, you gain a blessing of the indicated color.
Building walls and gates both require that there is no rubble, that you have the required amount of banners, and that you have the required resources. You can use 3 banners or one gold to get a discount of 1 resource when building.
Walls:
When building wall, draw 3 wall cards and place one of these over the wall space, gaining the effect shown on the card. No blessing reward, that is only for clearing rubble.Then place one of the unused wall cards on top of your deck, and the other on the bottom
Gates:
When building, grab the associated card from the side of the board and place it over the space. YOu gain any silver that was on the card. Take a worker from your supply and put it on here, it is now a gatekeeper and will remain here for the rest of the game. You then gain the printed immediate reward.
Victory points shown on walls/gates are only earned at the end of the game
Connecting walls and gates:
After building, a wall or gate may form a connection between another wall or gate. Players involved will receive rewards. You gain the reward shown on the gate for connecting walls to it. If you own the gate and built the wall, you only get the reward once, but if another player is involved, they get the reward as well.

Blue: Torah and Tenting around the city
Torah
When taking this action, players may teach the torah by placing a scribe on a chosen scroll tile, move their tent around the map of the city, or both (in either order). Teaching the torah gives you new passive abilities or bonus end game scoring opportunities.
Banner and resource cost to place worker is shown to the left of the row. Each tile here can only hold 1 scribe. You can only place on the bottom row at first. Once this is done, the two adjacent tiles above are unlocked for placement. In addition to costs shown for the row, you must pay 1 silver to each player you’re branching off of to reach the tile you place on. The first to place on the top row receives all of the food placed here during setup.
At the end of the game each scribe will score points based on row, shown to the right
Tenting:
Banners and resources to perform different strength movements are shown here. You gain each reward you cross over, and we can share spaces. You must do all of your movement as a single action. You can only pick one selection, not perform multiple or double.
Since you can do both of these actions you may be able to move your tent first to get the resources needed to drop a scribe (banners permitting)

Auxillary actions (limit one per turn):
Tradimg: 
available on the bottom of played cards. Two types of trades, resources into silver or silver into resources.
When trading silver for resources, that card will show a gate. Money is either payed to the owner of that gate if it is built, or if it not built it gets stacked on the card. this is only true for the first coin, any other coins paid go to the bank
Flip development tile
Pay the cost on the top left, them gain the green banner. Any workers already placed on the card will not move after it is flipped. No benefits are gained from workers retroactively
Using a trader and/or elder:
In addition to your main action you can use a trader and/or an elder. You may only use one of each
To do this, you place one worker on your player board in the appropriate slot. Green is trader, orange is merchant. The bonus gained from them will be shown on that slot to the right. These workers will return after the Sabbath ready to be used as any type of worker in the next round
Blessings (the jars)
Go up specified track, wild you get to pick. When you get at least 


Recap:
Mandatory (in order):
Play a card

Draw a card (if able)
Optional:
Auxillary action (1x)
Trader/elder

Sabbath (prep)
We’ve talked about how turns work, this will continue in the same turn order from the first player market until we've each had 6 turns. You can tell bc you'll have no legal card placements left on your board. After the 6th turn is done, we’ll prep for Sabbath. This phase is resolved by everyone simultaneously. You may use farmers and laborers, and must resolve the prophet’s judgement.  There may also be other effects that players have activate. You may resolve all of these elements in whatever order you like
Farmers/Laborers: 
If players have any workers left in their supply, they must assign them as farmers or laborers. Farmers are yellow worker spots w/ the food background, laborers are purple worker sports w/ the hammer. Both of these will immediately produce the printed resources, with laborers having a choice of 2 options. 
Prophet’s Judgement: We look at the altar card and resolve it’s effect based on where our flamer marker is on the altar track in relation to the prophets. 3 zones, behind, inbetween, and ahead of. The prophets will move after each sabbath, so you need to keep advancing on the track in order to get the good bonuses
