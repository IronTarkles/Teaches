## Overview

This is a deck building civilization game, set in a mythic age at the dawn of time. Although we've lived in balance humans settlers are showing up and ruining things. 

During turns you'll be using your cards to generate resources, erect new settlements, expand your empire, fight adversaries, and integrate new people into your tribe.

The map is made up of 4 types of territories tha match the colors of the resources

## Gameplay

On a turn you will have 5 cards in your hand, and they can be played for their effects in any order. You can also activate effects from cards played on the table and achievements, as well as spend or place your resources on cards

- Cards have their effect at the bottom
- Some cards show different effects split by a vertial line, you can only choose one of these options
- Cost to purchase a card is in the top right
- Pink banner is victory points
- If a card has squares depicting resources, that means those resources can be placed on the card
- At the end of your turn, you will discard any resources not spent or placed, discard all cards left in hand, and then draw 5 new cards for the next turn

Some cards are played on the table in front of you and do not go straight to your discard pile after use. These cards will contain the keywords "collect" or "store"

- Collect: You can place one or more resources on it. When all resources are placed, the effect is resolved and the card is discarded
- Store: You can place one or more resources to use on a later turn. When resources on the card are used, it is discarded (even if it wasn't full)

## Turn Structure

These are the main actions performed by cards

You must spend or place all resources produced on your turn, any not spent or placed at the end of your turn must be discarded.
