## Overview

- Played over 6 rounds, 
- Each round consists of 3 phases:
    - Take actions
    - Use Abilities
    - Resolve cuzco board (counter clockwise from top)
        - University
        - Temple
        - Market
        - Palace


## Phase 1: Die / Action phase

- Each player rolls their dice
- In turn order, place one die on an action space and perform action
- We will do this until all players have placed all 3 of their dice
- Die placement rules:
    - Die can be placed on a space where there are already die (even your own)
    - Die being placed has to be a lower value than everything else there already
    - This means that once a 1 is placed on a space, no other die can be placed there that round

### The Actions

#### Movement: Move your Chaski from one place to an adjacent place

- 4 player game this is split into two for moving across stone trail or rope bridge
- You many only use a route if the pip value of that route is less than or equal to the value of your die
- If you move to a village, take the next available tile from your board and place it there. 
    - You gain a feather of the color shown in the village. The feather gets slotted in the matching color space of your mask. One placed, can’t be moved. 
    - If you’ve already got 3 feathers of that color in your mask, you can still visit that village and place a tile, you just don’t gain the feather.
    - Removing tiles frees up space for future study or farming tiles.
    - Tiles on villages are also worth points at the end of the game, but only if your tile is on top. If another player visits the village, their tile will be placed on top of yours. They would score the points at the end of the game for that village, not you.
    - If you revisit a village with one of your tiles later in the game, you do not place another, but you do get another feather.
- If your Chaski moves to the center space (Cuzco), you do not place a tile. Instead you gain a fire bessing (more on that later). Whenever you leave Cuzco, you may rotate the center tile however you like to give yourself more options

#### Study (orange) & farming (blue)

- Take a tile of the matching color from the palace area of the Cuzco board. Tile grabbed must be from a die value equal to or lesser than the die that you placed.
- The tile goes onto an empty space of your mask. You start with 2 empty, and the rest will be unlocked through visiting villages
- Offer of tiles is replenished at the end of the round

#### Gain points action (number 2)

- You guessed it, just gain 2 points
- Rule of lesser value die is ignored for this space

#### Exchange action

- You’re effectively using the pips of your die to perform the exchanges shown on the space. You have up to the number of pips on the die you placed to perform these actions at these costs
- One pip
    - Gain a point
    - Slide down a tile
        - Study
            - If you slide down a study tile, you gain the knowledge show on the tile (grey swirl)
            - Each knowledge point moves you up one on the knowledge track in the university
            - Knowledge track will gain you points and set turn order in phase 3
        - Farming
            - Sliding farming tile down gains you the food shown
            - Food is used to buy goods at the market
- Two pips
    - Gain an offering (coin), which are used to play god cards
    - Take a god card into your hand
        - Add face up card from display to hand
        - Immediately reveal new card
    - Take a feather of any color
    - Relocate one kipu tile on board
        - Take the next tile from a slot on your board and place it into the slot below your board. These can only be used to place in villages once you run out of others

#### Temple action

- Place a priest on a step of the temple
- Value of your die determines the step where you place (exact value, not less than!)
- There can only ever be one priest on each step
- If you place on a step with a priest already, everything below is pushed down one space, filling any gaps
- Priests that get pushed off of the bottom step return to that player’s board
- Priests in the temple will award points in phase 3
- Every time you place a priest, you gain a fire blessing (fire icon shown on space)

#### Headdress action

- Allows you to activate circlet tiles (ones along the top under feathers)
- Can only activate a tile if the number of pips on the tile is less than or equal to the value of the die placed
- Can only activeate a tile with feathers in both of its slots
- When you activate a tile, immediately gain the points and then flip the tile over.
- You gain extra points for the round in which you did this
- Acivating a circlet tile also gains you a fire blessing

### Fire blessings

- Effects of fire blessing are summarized at the top of your player aide
- Gain a god card or an offering
- Gain a knowledge or a food
Phase 2
Each player in turn order will use one ability from one of their placed study tiles, and one ability from a placed farming tile in either order
You’ll notice that I said “one ability” and not “one tile
If you have tiles that match, that means you would activate all tiles that show that same ability. This only applies to study and farming tiles separately
Stone trail tiles work differently if you have more than one of them
Normally you would move across a trail that is up to the die value depicted
Multiple tiles make that value additive, 3 tiles make it where you could move across any trail of that type
Tiles depicting grabbing a study/farming tile work the same way.
Phase 3
We will activate the areas of the cuzco board, following the arrows along the river
University
Each player gains the points indicated by their knowledge marker placement
Tiles get stacked up with the furthest progressing on top, and this determines the new turn order

Player w/ most priests gains a medal from the top of the temple

Just a check for total, you do not spend
You gain 6 points for completing a mission
If unable to complete, choose a mission tile to remove from the game, and you do not gain points
Choose one of the mission tiles from the palace, placing it in your empty mission slot
Tiles are not replenished until the end of round
