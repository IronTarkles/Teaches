## Overview

This is a bag building game where we're rival train companies building a shared network of routes and stations to deliver goods to

On a turn you'll pull chips from your bag, and those chips will determine what you can do on your turn. You'll use these chips to build railsway, stations, and deliver goods. You can also buy new chips to make your bag better

## Round structure

At the start of the round we'll reveal a production card which will pop some goods out on to the map.

We will then award subsidies if necessary. The point track is broken down into segments. If you have an entire segment between you and the person in first place, you'll get a lightning train. You can get a max of two lightning trains this way.

Getting a lightning train just means that you'll pull one of the train chips from your supply, but more on that later.

Each player will then take one turn. We will keep playing rounds like this until the end of the game is triggered.

A turn is broken down into two major parts:

- The operations phase, where you will take actions
- The turnover phase, where you will clean up for the next turn

## The playerboard and chips

Before jumping in to how to do things, lets talk about the playerboard and how tiles work since you'll be using them for everything.

### Boarding area

The leftmost portion of your board is the boarding area, where you will put tiles that you draw from your bag. For your turn, you will draw tiles out of your bag until the 5 blank empty spaces are filled up. If when pulling chips out of your bag you pull chips that have the plus symbol on them, they will slot into the spaces with the plus icon. Any time you get a lightning train (from a chip or other source), you will grab a basic train chip from your supply and put it in the boarding area on the lightning symbol so it won't take up any slots for normal chips. So plus symbols and lightning train symbols will allow you to go over the normal 5 chip limit

### Railyard

All the empty spaces on your playerboard are your railyard actions.

- These spaces can only be filled with train chips
- You move train chips from your boarding area to empty action spaces
- Some actions show a little red banner with a station, like the Secure Contract action.
    - This means you can not assign train chips (or take the action) unless you have at least that number of stations built
- To take an action:
    - All spaces for that action must be filled with train chips
    - You must remove the train chips from those spaces and set them in your warehouse area (off to the side of your board on the right)
    - You are not required to take the action now. Train chips can stay on railyard actions between turns, so you can load up an action now to take on a later turn
- You MUST assign any remaining trains in your boarding area to empty railyard spaces if able before ending your turn

### Actions

#### Build a station

You start the game with six cubes at the top of your board, these are your station markers.

To build a station, you must meet 2 criteria:

- Have a contract for the region where you will be building the station (more on this in a moment)
- Each city shows a cost to build a station there, you must spend that many train chips from the railyard action

If you meet those criteria, then:

- Choose a face up station from one of the slots on the board and move it to the location where you're building
- Take the leftmost station marker from your board and put it on the station
- Refill the station slot w/ one of the same size from the supply

#### Secure Contracts

One of the criteria to build things like a station is having a contract. Everone starts with a couple hybrid contracts that are one time use. The color and letter on the contract cooresponds to the zone of the board that it allows you to build in. Starting contracts are lost after using, but the secure contract action on your board allows you to act as if you had any contract for the rest of your turn.

#### Building a rail line

This is not an action on your playerboard, but it makes sense to talk about it here. 

A rail line is a series of train chips played on an empty path between cities on the game board. Rail lines are used to make deliveries and score points

You may only build 1 rail line per turn. To build a rail line, you must meet the following requirements:

- You must have a contract for the region where you want to build. If the line crosses a region boundary, a contract for either region will suffice.
- You must be able to fill every slot of the path using train chips
    - Generally, these will all come from your boarding area or line storage
    - If you have a station in the city on either end of the rail line, you may use a rail chip from your supply (max of 1 even if you own cities on both sides)
- The rail line must have a connection to one of the following:
    - One of the starting cities on the eastern seaboard with the sun symbol
    - A city where you have a station
    - One of your existing rail lines
- If there is a mountain path (paths marked with brown slots) you must be able to tunnel by having a tunnel icon from one of these sources:
    - A chip in your boarding area
    - An action card you've played
    - Or by taking the use explosives railyard action

If you meet all the requirements, put out the train chips and then score points equal to the number of stars on one end of the link.

Now that we've coverd a lot of the concepts, lets take a look at the rest of the railyard actions

#### Line Storage

Not an action you take on it's own. You store a train chip here to use on a later turn whenever you build a rail line as part of that line

#### Use Explosives

When you use this action, you get one of two effects:

- Get a tunnel symbol for this turn to build on mountain paths
- Build an additional rail line this turn (normal limit is one)

If you had enough train chips, you could fill this space up and remove trains multiple times in a turn to build more than 2 rail lines

#### Industrialize

Requires 2 stations. When you take this action, flip that board over and you now have two more + spaces in your boarding area

#### Going public

Requires 2 stations, gets you 2 new passive bonuses

- Whenever you generate 7 money or more on your turn, you score two points
- For every delivery icon you get 1 lightning train

#### Deliveries

Another action not on your player board. A delivery uses a series of rail lines to move goods to a city that wants them from the closest connected producer city.

You may make any number of deliveries on your turn, but each delivery requires either:

- A delivery icon on a chip in your boarding area or a card you've played
- Spending one of the delivery tokens that you start the game with

To make a delivery, follow these steps:
- Choose a station with at least one goods request
- Identify the closest connected producer city with a face up goods token corresponding to the request
    - Connected means there must be an unbroken route of rail lines between the two cities. These rails can belong to different players.
    - Closest meants you must use the fewest number of rail lines possible (lines, not individual train chips). In the event of a tie, you use the route with the most train chips
- Award points for the route
    - For each rail line along the route, its owner gets 1 point.
    - If the destination station has a player's station marker on it, that player gets 1 point
- Take the goods toekn from the producer city and put it face down on the station, covering the goods request icon. This means each request can only be met once each game.

#### Spending Money

With this action, you buy new chips from the market. Some of the chips in your boarding area will generate money, this is the total you can spend this turn. If you trash a chip, you still get to use any money it generated this turn. Any money not spent on a turn is lost.

A chip's cost is determined by the compartment that it is in. When you buy a chip, it goes to your warehouse to get put in your bag later. Chips are immediately replenished

- Chips have notches on them to show the initial cost. Place the new chip in the leftmost empty space of that compartment. If the slots in that compartment are already full, create an empty space by sliding chips there one slot to the left. If you are unable to do so, move chips further down the market to the left, including moving the very first chip off of the board and into the trash.

In addition to the chips in the market, there are some other ways printed on the board to spend money:

- For $2, you may buy one of the $1+ chips placed in setup if there are any remaining
- for $4, if the lighting train market toek has been moved here already (from the scoring track), you may take a lightning train
- For $7 you may take a lightning train and score 1 point
- For $8, you may take two lightning trains and score 1 point

You can also take a loan to increase how much money you have to spend on a turn

- Take a loan chip from the bank and put it in your warehouse, you now have $1 more to spend this turn. You can only do this once per turn.
- Paying off a loan requires you to pay $4 on a later turn when the chip is in your boarding area

### Lightning trains

We've talked about getting lightning trains a lot of different ways. Just to recap, whenever you get the lightning train symbol from anywhere, you just take a train chip from your supply and put it in the lightning area of your boarding area to use this turn. You also get one from:

- Every 2 conductor icons (reminder on top left of playerboard)
- If you went public and get a delivery symbol ( just get the symbol, you don't have to make a delivery)


## Turnover phase

Once your turn is done, any chips left in your boarding area go to your warehouse. If you used a starting contract in your boarding area to do an action this turn, it is trashed instead. Draw new chips to fill your boarding area, and the next player can trake their turn

## Transcontinental Railroad

The moment there is an unbroken route of rail lines connecting New York and San fransico, we pause to do a scoring.

- Determine the shortest route as if you were making a delivery
- For each train chip on that route, its owner scores 2 points
- No player can build stations anymore

## Game end

Game end is trigered if the transcontinental railroad has been established, and specific cities are connected to it

- Less than four players either Houston, Seattle, or both
- 4 players both Houston and Seattle

Finish out the round that this happens in, and then play 1 more full round. After the end of the final round, in turn order all players will make one last delivery as if they had a delivery icon

- Each player loses 2 points for each loan chip they have anywhere
- Each player reveals and scores all of their goal cards
