We're cloth traders in this dry euro

This is a worker placement-ish game that uses area majority scoring to accrue the most victory points

We will trigger these area majority scorings throughout the game whenever worker spaces get too crowded

On a turn you will place a worker, activate your worker totake your actions, activate any players workers under yours, and then check for a scoring

Let's walk through the steps of a turn:

1:Placing a worker
On your turn you will either place a family member (player colored) or contractor (white) onto the checkered action portion of the main board. They are placed colored side down
You can place onto an empty space, or one with workers already there
Each action space is adjacent to exactly 2 actions, either an action tile or the central contribute action
You must be able to complete at least on of the actions. If you are unable to complete either action, it is not a legal placement space
Once your worker has been placed, you may then complete both actions in either order
Contractor workers allow you to do each action TWICE. These 4 actions may be completed in any order. Since they're not player colored, they don't belong to anyone once placed, and will not be reactivated by other workers later.
If you would place your worker on a stack of 3 other workers, first remove the bottom worker from the stack. Flip it to its colored side and put in the plaza above the action area. This worker will trigger a scoring later in your turn

2: Reactivate other workers
If your worker was placed on top of other family members (yours or other players) they will now be activated. Each player with a worker in that stack (including you) will now get to take those actions
Remember, only family members. The white contractors are not reactivated.

Break to talk about impossible actions and actions cards
When carrying out your turn, or having your workers activated by other players, you may find yourself unable to take triggered actions. This is called an impossible actions, and you will be compensated for it.
For impossible actions, you will draw a card from the action deck. The active player will only draw one card per turn this way, regardless of the number of impossible actions. All other players will receive 1 card per impossible action
You can't choose not to take the action to draw a card, it most be impossible for you to perform that action
You can play action cards before or after completing an action, either when placing or reactivating a worker
Just because an action is possible does not mean you have to take it. You can always decide to not perform an action off of an activation.

3: Evaluate a scoring tile
If a scoring was triggered from placing a worker earlier in your turn, it is now resolved
The worker removed earlier will be moved from the plaza to the next empty scoring tile
If the worker was a contractor, instead add it to your supply and put one of your family members onto the scoring space
Evaluate the scoring tile. Each tile looks at a different part of the board and awards VP based on majority. 3 points for 1st, 2 for 2nd, and one for 3rd. You must have a cube present to get points.
If two or more players are tied, ties are broken by:
Number of components: workers on the scoring track + cubes in the plaza
Number or workers on the scoring track
Most recently placed worker on earlier placed scoring tiles
Leftmost player cube on statue in plaza
Active player or closest to active player in turn order

4: pass the active player marker
After scoring any tiles, the active player marker will pass clockwise and the n CT player will carry out their turn
Placing a worker, taking actions, reactivating workers, and doing a scoring if it was triggered 

Talk about the scoring areas (rulebook)

The actions:
Gain resources (brick wood or marble)
These 3 actions all done the same way, cloth is not considered a resource
Take 1 player cube from your supply and put it in the matching warehouse at the bottom of your player board
Considered impossible if the warehouse is full
Weave (green cloth cube)
Add one cloth for each of your workshops
For each workshop on your player board grab 1 cube and add to any open spaces on workshops
Can be added or removed from any workshop when needed
Considered impossible if all workshops are full 
Build
Ship is 2 wood. Placed in the dock on your player board and determine how much cloth you can send during the ship action
Workshop is 1 wood 1 brick. Placed at the top of your player board and allow you to gain more cloth during the weave action
Trading house is 2 brick. They go next to the cities on the left side and determine where you can send cloth with a transport action. There is room for a trading house from each player in each city, no duplicates.
Impossible if you do not have sufficient resources for anything
Sponsor a statue
One marble to at either a church or the main plaza. Cube from supply to that area
Ship 
Deliver 1 cloth for each ship in your dock to any of the cities on the right.
If you have more than one ship, you can deliver your cubes to any combination of cities
Cubes come from your workshops
Transport
Deliver 1 cloth to each of your trading houses. If you have less cloth that trading houses, you decide where it goes. 
Contribute
Move items from your storehouses to the appropriate row in one of the churches
