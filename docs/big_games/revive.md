- Intro / Theme
    -Who are we?
    -What are we doing?
   	 -Explore locations
   	 -Recruit citizens
   	 -Build buildings
   	 -Populate

- Round Structure
    -turns in clockwise order
    -up to 2 actions (may repeat)
    OR hibernate (refresh/pass turn)

-Brief summary of actions
    -playing cards to gain resources/benefits
    -switch to copy effects
    -explore to flip new tiles
    -populate to unlock new tech tree
    -build to get machine progress
    -if you can't take at least one action, you must hibernate
-Free actions
    -convert crystals to resources
    -use machines once unlocked
    -open crates

-Standard Actions
    -Playing a card
   	 -Talk about playing in different slots
   	 -Symbols on cards
   		 -resources
   		 -faction action (star)
   		 -Module get
   	 -Explain slot modules/synergy
   	 -Explain cards with additional slots on them
   	 -Explain difference between active and resting
   	 -Explain locked module
    -Switch action
   	 -Copy effect on someone else's card, it then goes to their rest stack
   	 -Only reset during hibernate
    -Range
   	 -Pay 1 food for each tile in between source and destination (each space you have to cross)
   		 -This means directly adjacent is free, bc nothing in between
   	 -Start of the game, count range from chasm
   	 -Once you have pieces on the board, range must be counted from closest piece to destination
   	 -Can't count range through unexplored tiles
    -Explore action
   	 -How you flip over tiles
   	 -Range + cost on tile
   	 -Flip over and gain benefit
   	 -Rewards on card
   		 -blue points are poitns now, purple are endgame
   		 -point out point track/rewards
   		 -talk about citizen reward being from lineup
   	 -You choose how tile is oriented
    -Populate action
   	 -count range from a space where you have a peice to a tile where you want to populate
   	 -you can't already have a population figure there, but an opponent can
   	 -can't populate if there is a building in the space
   	 -choose population figure from tech tree you want to use
   		 -has to be an available space, first one will be bottom of tree
   		 -subsequent uses of this action will allow you to choose which one
   	 -cost is number of books shown on tech space plus one for each opponent currently in space
   	 -passive bonus unlocked for the rest of the game, or an immediate effect
   	 -Talk about large location spaces for endgame scoring
    -Build action
   	 -Can only build in sand spaces
   	 -only one building per space (no doubling up, no sharing)
   	 -Pay range to space where you want to build
   	 -pay gears for cost of building (3 for small, five for large)
   	 -after placing building, gain reward from adjacent spaces
   		 -arrows are progress on respective machine tracks (more on that in a minute)
   		 -large buildings will double effect from spaces
   		 -water tile effects can't be doubled, and can only be claimed once per game
   		 -crystal tiles on edge of board
   	 -talk about gaining rewards for exisiting building when adjacent mystery tile is explored
    -THE MACHINE
   	 -When moving up different color tracks, you'll move progress markers to the lowest relvealed VP space on progress track
   	 -Uncovered spaces are eitehr pre-set machines, or blank spaces where you can grab a machine from the market (has to match color)
   	 -To use machines, you must move an energy from the central power bank to the specific machine you want to use (free action)
   	 -Final space on the machine track is endgame scoring
   	 -If you would increase again when maxed, you gain the resource shown
   	 -Talk about progress track rewards

    -Hibernate
   	 -return energy
   	 -rest goes to active, all cards from slot go to resting
   	 -switch resets
   	 -go up on hibernate track. Gain reward shown on space or any space below
   	 -4th space means you grab major artifact and remove from game, NOT GAIN IT
   	 -on hibernate turns, you may not use main actions, you can use free actions like energy for machines. Can only use before hibernate, not after.
    -End Game
   	 -Game ends whenever last major artifact is grabbed
   		 -player that grabs the last major artifact also grabs endgame tile from stack of minor artifacts
   		 -all OTHER players get one additional turn
   		 -if a player would gain a major artifact on their last turn, they gain a minor artifact instead
   	 -Endgame points come from
   		 -progress track
   		 -explore end game tiles on edge of board
