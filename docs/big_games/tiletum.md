## Overview

We're rich merchants starting our journey from the city of Tiletum during the early days of the renaissance.

The game is played over 4 rounds, each with a soring that will occur for a specific condition. These conditions are listed at the top of the board along with a location. You must have presense at that location to be eligible to score.

At the start of the round the dice are rolled and placed, then we flip over a token to move on the king track. Your position on the king track will determine if you gain or lose points at the end of the round. The tokens are always 0 or worse.

## Round overview

### Preparation phase

At the start of the round the dice are rolled and placed, then we flip over a token to move on the king track. Your position on the king track will determine if you gain or lose points at the end of the round. The tokens are always 0 or worse.

### Action phase

A turn consists of you grabbing a die, then gaining resources and action points based on the value of the die. The color of the die and the visible pips indicate how much of what resource you will gain. The opposide face of the die is how many actions points you will have to spend. This is shown by the number in parenthesis on the wheel. For instance, a 3 die would get you 3 of the resource of the matching color, and 4 action points to spend.

The sections of the wheel are broken up into the different actions. A die grabbed from that section means all of your action points will be spent doing that action this turn. When you grab a die, if there is a bonus tile there, you may take it and add it to your storehouse. There are a lot of different bonus tiles that can be used for everything from free resources to free actions. Tiles are never used immediately, they must be placed in your storehouse on you player board. This means you must have a free space in your storehouse to grab a bonus tile.

After you have grabbed a die, gained your resources, and carried out your action, the next person will take a turn. We will each take 3 turns per round.

### King phase

Once everyone has taken all of their turns, we move to the king phase.

- The player highest on the track can grab the bonus tile
- All players either gain or lose points based on their position on the track
- Turn order changes based on who is highest on the king track, bottommost token breaking ties
- All players in the red negative portion of the king track are moved to zero, all players in the positive portion are left where they are

### Fair phase

This is when the objective for the round is scored. A total of 4 fairs will be held during the game, each in a different city with a different scoring criteria. 

To participate in the scoring you must either:

- Have a house in the town where the scoring takes place
- Have your merchant meeple present in that town

House spots on the map are limited and are first come first serve. 

### Cleanup phase

- Empty bonus tile places on the action wheel are refilled
- Board bonus tiles never refill
- New corruption tokens are placed
- Dice are returned to be rerolled at the start of the next round
- The action wheel rotates

This means that actions will change strength over the course of the game. For instance the action that starts with 6 action points will get weaker as the game goes on and never be that strong again.

## Actions: How do they work

Many actions have different ways to use your action points. It is always up to you how to distribute them, and you can use points for the same part of an action as many times as you want or are able to

### Architect

The compass. All architect actions take 1 action point:

- Move your architect meeple 1 space on the board
- Take a bonus tile from a town where your architect meeple is located if available
- Place a pillar from your supply on a town.
    - The town must have an empty spot for a pillar
    - The town can't already have your pillar
    - Pillars are used to construct buildings which we'll go over later

### Merchant

The wagon. All merchant actions take 1 action point:

- Move your merchant meeple 1 space on the board
- Take a bonus tile from a town where your meeple is
- Add a house from your supply to a town
    - Town must have empty space for your house
    - Town can't already have a house of yours
    - You must have a house available in your supply (more on that later)
- Some house spaces provide an instant benefit

### Character action

The head. There is a character offer on the board where tiles are available to purchase with this action

- 1 AP: Take a character tile from the offer and put it in your storehouse. Refill offer immediately
- 1 AP: Discard all characters from lineup and refill immediately. All discarded tiles are mixed in with the off board supply immediately
- 1/2/3 AP: Move a character from your storehouse onto your playerboard. The cost is equal to the floor of the room in the house that you're moving the person into

Your playerboard contains six buildings with varying amounts of rooms. The rightmost building is already occupied.

Room placement rules:

- You can't have mutliple buildings with the same character in them
- As soon as a character is placed in a room you immediately recieve the bonus on the character tile
- As soon as a building has all of its rooms filled with character tiles, you take the house from the roof space and add it to your supply. It is now able to pbe placed with the merchant action.

During the game you may get crests. A crest can be placed onto a house from an ammount of food and immediately gains you the printed benefit. More on this later

When a house is completely full and has a crest you will gain the action bonus tile for that column. Now any time afterwards that you take the action depicted on the people in that building you will get that many bonus action points.

### Contract action

The scroll. There is a contract offer with tiles available to purchase for different prices.

- ? AP: Take a contract tile, spending the action points shown for the cost.
- 1 AP: Exchange a resource for a different resource. The first time you do this on your turn (and only once), you get a free resource.

Contracts are not refilled immediately. At the end of your turn you shift everything down and then refill.

### King action

The crown. Nice and easy, just move up the king track once for each action point.

### Joker action

The jester hat. Basically a wild action. Choose another action, then spend all of your action points as if you had taken that action this round.

## Tasks aka Free Actions

You can do any amount of these on your turn. Before, after, or between spending aciton points. 

- Spend 2 gold to gain one of any other resource
- Fufill a contract by paying resources depicted on the tile. Move the contract to the furthest left space on your board. Gain the pillar if there is one, then gain the points shown.
- Spend food to move a crest from your storehouse to your houses paying the food cost and get the bonus action
- Build a cathedral by spending the amount of stone shown. Gain the points immediately. You can only have one of each cathedral
- Use a "helper" tile in your storehouse (usually ones that get you bonus actions)

## End game

After the end of the fourth round, we go to final scoring. 

- Multiply the number of your houses on the map by the number of pillars, gain that many points
- Gain points based on the number of completed buildings you have
- For every 4 leftover resources, you gain 1 points


## Expansion stuff

- Silver
    - Does not count as a basic resource, so you can't trade 2 gold for it, or get it from the contract action conversion.
- Tech trees
    - As a free action during the game, you can pay silver to advance up any tech tree. Once you progress to higher level techs, the lower ones in that column still apply. So when you hit level 3, the level 1 and 2 benefits still apply.
- The underground
    - New boards on the side of the map. Everyone starts with a mine and a prospector on the starting underground map.
    - Free action to pay the cost to add a new prospector to  a different undergound map
- New action wheel that provides new benefits.
    - The one with the bonus space is the new prospector action. When selecting a die from this wedge you can either do the action on the normal portion of the wheel, OR the prospector action
    - The other side of this wheel is a free action that you get in addition to the main action taken that just lets you move your prospector 1 space.

### Prospector action

The axe and hammer. All prospector actions cost 1 AP.

- Move your prospector on any board 1 space. If you cross a stone tablet without an X tile on it, immediately gain the benefit and then add an X tile to block it off.
- Take an underground bonus tile from the town where your prospector meeple is
- Add a mine from your personal supply to the town where your prospector meeple is
    - Must be room for it
    - Must have one available in your supply
    - Immediately recieve 1 silver
    - You may also recive gold from the space where you placed your mine
- Add a pillar to the town where your prospector is
    - Must be room for it
    - Must have one available.
    - Can only have one of your color
- Add a house to the town where your prospector is
    - Must be room for it
    - Must have one available
    - Can only have one of your color

King phase works a little different

- Gain income, one sliver per placed mine
- If your marker is 0 or above, get a new mine into your supply
- If you're high enough on the track, get bonus silver

When the action wheel rotates clockwise, the expansion wheel rotates counterclockwise
