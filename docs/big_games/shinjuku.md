## Overview

We're playing Japanese companies that run competing rail lines and stores in rail stations. The aim of the game is to build stores for customers to shop at, and build the rail lines to get them there

### The Map

The map is broken up into 23 different wards in Tokyo, and the trainstations in each ward (the circleds and squares) are where we can open stores.

Stations are show lines where rail can be constructed to connect them

### Ward Cards

The deck is made of cards that correspond to the different wards. The card will have the name of the ward, show its location on the map, and also show how many cards of that ward are in the deck

### Customers

Circular white tokens that represent customers will be marked with the type of good that customer wants to purchase. Some tokens will be yellow and represent 2 customers. There is an uneven distribution of customers, and the fewer a total customer type, the more 2x tokens there are.

## Gameplay

On each player's turn will look like this:

- Place new customers on the map
- Refresh the customer queue
- Optionally move CEOs/Kaiju if present
- Perform 2 actions
