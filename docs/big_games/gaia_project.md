Gaia Project Teach

We are different races trying to peacefully colonize the galaxy. Each race has different environmental needs, which has lead all the races to master terraforming. We will colonize new planets, build structures, and unite planets to form federations. The game is played over 6 rounds, and at the end, the player with the most victory points will win.

So me sources of victory points are the round scoring tiles, which will award points during each round for taking different actions, the 2 end game times, which will award points based on how well players fulfilled certain criteria, federation tokens, tech tree progress, and some tech tiles.

Each round consists of 4 phases. Income, Gaia, actions, and clean up. We will all take income and Gaia phase, then take turns doing one action each in turn order. After everyone has passed, we will perform cleanup and move to the next round

During income, every hand symbol will reward you with resources. Ore (white) and knowledge (blue)can go up to 15, credits can go up to 30. You can also receive power.and charge power as income

###############
How power works#
###############

Purple area of board split into different numbered areas. You can only spend power in area ⅔ of your board. To get it there, you’ll have to charge it. (Point out charge power icon) When you charge power, it has to be moved from area 1 to 2, and then only when area 2 is empty, to area 3. You can't charge power if all of it is already in area 3. Spending power moves it from area 3 back to area 1. 

There are also effects that allow you to gain or discard power. When gaining power, grab it from the supply and put it in area 1. When discarding power, you can remove from anywhere except Gaia area. More on the Gaia area later

So that was income. We will skip over Gaia phase now and move straight to actions

###########
Build a mine#
###########
How to build. Mines are the only structure that can be directly built on a planet to colonize them. Cost is shown by mines, 2 credits and one ore. Can only build if the follow criteria are met:
Planet is empty (no structures)
It is accessible from one of your planets
It is habitable by your faction. If not, you must pay to terraform.

Accessibility:
(Always max, you can do less)
Determined by your progress on the navigation tech track (gray). At levels 0 and 1, your basic range is one, so you can only build on adjacent planets.

When counting distance, you just count the shortest path between one of your planets and where you int and to build. This path can be a straight line through other planets (even colonized ones)

Additionally, you can always spend one QIC (little green cube) to increase your distance by 2

Habitability

Terraforming
Your home planet type can be naturally built on (the one of your player color). Otherwise, you will need a number of terraforming steps as indicated by the chart on your player board. The cost of each terraforming step is determined by your progress on terraforming tech track. Starts at 3 ore per step. 

Purple planets (trans dimm) can't be built on. They can be converted to a green planet by using a gaiformer.

Green planets can be built on by paying a QIC

#############
Upgrade action#
#############

You can only ever build mines onto empty planets. All other structures have to be upgraded into. The connections or upgrade paths are shown on your player board.

When an upgraded structure is placed, the original structure is placed back on your player board in the rightmost position. Just like mines, building are pulled from the leftmost space.

Mine > trading station (3/6 + 2)
Discounted credits if there is an opponents neighboring structure (range of 2 away)

Trading station > planetary institute (6 + 4)
Planetary institute immediately allows access to an asymmetric faction power.

Trading station > research lab (5 + 3)
Gain tech tile

Research lab > academy (6 + 6)
You choose which to build, also gain tech tile

###############
Gaining tech tiles#
###############
 Tech tiles can gain you a number of benefits, and when you grab one, you will advance in a tech tree as well.  Most of the time, you’ll be grabbing a basic tech tile. 

If you grab a tech tile from directly below a tree, advance in that tree. If you grab on of the 3 not associated with a tree, go up on any tree.

You can grab any standard you want, but can't have multiples.

Instead of taking a standard, you can take an advanced if you meet some conditions. When you grab an advanced tile, you go up one on any track.
Must be at level 4 or 5 in that research track
Must own a federation token green side up. You will then flip to gray
Must have an uncovered standard tile. You will then cover the standard tile, blocking it's effect

##############
Research tracks#
##############
You can pay 4 knowledge to go up on a research track of your choice. Going up to level 5 also requires you to flip a federation token to its grey side. Only one person can be in level 5 at one time. Some new levels will give you a one time bonus (white outline), some will give you passive benefits.

Brown is terraforming efficacy
Grey is navigation (range)
Green is AI (gets you QIC)
Purple is Gaia project
Yellow is economy (income)
Blue is science (knowledge income)

###########
Federations#
###########
To get federation tiles, you have to make a federation of your planets. You can make as many as you want in a game, but each planet can only be a part of one federation.


You form federations with planets you have built structures on with a total power of 7 or more. Planets that are directly adjacent are conn cted, for other planets you will have to discard one power each  to build satellites to connect them.

A space can only hold one satellite of any player color. You cannot choose to make a federation with unnecessary planets added, you must use as few satellites as possible.

###################
Power and qic actions#
###################

The bottom of the research board  shows purple and green spaces. To take the action in a purple space, spend the required amount of power (from area 3). To take a green action, spend the depicted amount of qics.

Each power and QIC action can only be taken once per round. These will be blocked off with an action token after being taken.

#############
Special actions#
#############

Orange spaces indicate a special action. Unlike the other colored octagon spaces, these have no cost and are available only to the player with the component they appear on. These can also only be used once per round and will be blocked off with an action tile after use.

##########################
Free actions and power charge#
##########################

In addition to your main action, you can take any number of free actions on your turn.

Discard a power token to move power from area 2 to area 3 ( this can be done even if you have power tokens in area 1)

Conversion chart on your board are all free actions

Whenever someone builds a power in the neighboring area of one of your structures (2 away) you may spend vo to charge power. You pay vp based on how much power you would charge (the power value of the building). 0/1/2/3 vp for 1/2/3/4 power charged. If you have multiple buildings, you only charge the highest power one.

You must pay for all of it unless you either only able to charge fewer power than the max, or can't pay for all of it. Otherwise you are not allowed to shortchange just to spend less.

##########################
Passing and the round boosters#
##########################

When you pass, you're out for the round. When you pass, take one of the 3 available round booster tiles, then return the one you held. You must swap, you can't use the same booster across multiple rounds by holding onto it. 

Place the new booster facedown in front of you to show that you've already passed.

Round boosters that show an icon for activating when you pass are triggered the round you RETURN the booster.

Whoever passes first also becomes the new first player.
