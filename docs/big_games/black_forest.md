## The Resource Wheel

Left wheel is glass production, right wheel is cooking. Hands split wheel into 2 parts. Larger is basic resources, smaller is refined resources.

- Brick track on left is also basic resource
- Tokens position indicates how much of a resource you currently have
- 7 max basic
- 3 max refined
- When you gain resources, move token up, when you spend, move token down.
- Charcoal is not gained on both sides at once, pick one. Spent in any combination.

Not many actions to directly gain refined resources, you will mainly produce them yourself. This happens automatically (and non voluntarily) as soon as the dial has room to move on the wheel. 

- Show example of all resources above one, and wheel moving to “spend” them to produce
- Wheel only moves if arrows have a free space in front of them on both sides
- Show example with refined resource at 3 when basic resources are all above one
- Resources gained from actions must be gained in their entirety, it is gain X, not gain up to X

## Turn Structure

What a Turn looks like:

### Moving

- On first move of game you will place pawn into empty village space in any village ( no resource cost)
- On following turns you must always move your pawn 
    - Empty spot in same village for no cost
    - Empty space in any other village (You must pay one provision for every road traveled (no limit))
- If you end in a village with other players, you must pay each player one basic resource (only applies if you move into a new village)
- Moving player always pays, receiving player can decline to gain after it is paid
- You must end in a spot where you can legally use one of the tradespeople

### Visit tradespeople

This is how you take the actions in the game

- After moving, visit one or both adjacent spots
- Many are basic conversions, like pay thing to get thing
- Some move glass bead on your estate board
    - When you reach top you expand estate by grabbing small estate board + 2 small forest tiles. Bead restarts at bottom and scores you points
- Some tiles let you take actions based on what is in your estate, or adding stuff to estate, or removing stuff in your estate
- Free action to destroy pond, field, or pasture (not forest)

#### Animals

- Cattle
    - Kept in stable (2)
- Pigs
    - A single pig can be kept in an uncleared forest
- Pasture can hold 3 of any one type

#### Building Buildings

All stored on, you guessed it, the building boards

- Only 1 of each
- Resource cost shown on left
    - Cost will always contain an amount of wood and/or brick, more powerful building require glass and other resources
    - Left column cost 0 glass, middle 1, right 2, large buildings 3
- Pay cost, put in empty space in estate, immediately gain benefit
    - Beige background is instant bonus
    - Blue background is new free action (usually conversions)
    - Red background is passive effect
    - Gold background is endgame points (mainly on large buildings)
- Sign to the left of each row shows you the primary resource gained from that building type. You need meat? Look at the meat row

#### Travelling merchant

-  Choose a resource, you get 2, all other players optionally all gain 1
-  Can optionally spend one commodity to swap merchant with any tradesperson on board (only use for commodities)

#### Completing a job (scroll tiles)

- Won’t be able to take these actions until you produce for the second time and hit your scroll
- Lets you take a resource and take the top job from the stack
    - Place location jobs where symbols match
    - If tradesperson job, put it in village w/ that tradesperson symbol (if full next village clockwise)
- You can move to a location and complete the job. Immediately draw another and place.
- Make sure you have enough provisions to move away from the job site

#### Begging

- Typically will only do if you run out of provisions
- If you beg from village, move to center of village
- If you beg from job site, just stay where you are
- Gain 1 provision

## Game end

- Game end triggered by one or both of provision markers reaching the hourglass on the resource wheel.
- All players now play 1 more turn (including person that triggered end)
- Flip over the medium sized bluilding board and use player pawns to mark scores

### Scoring

- 1 point per glass
- Points for where the arrow is pointing to on your right cooking wheel
- 2 points per small estate
- 1 point per livestock on a pasture
- Points for your constructed buildings
- Points from building that give end game scoring
