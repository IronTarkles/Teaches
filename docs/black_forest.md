How the resource wheel works
Left wheel is glass production, right wheel is cooking
Hands split wheel into 2 parts
Larger is basic resources
Smaller is refined resources
Brick track on left is also basic resource
Tokens position indicates how much of a resource you currently have
7 max basic
3 max refined
When you gain resources, move token up, when you spend, move token down
Charcoal is not gained on both sides at once, pick one. Spent in any combination.
Not many actions to directly gain refined resources, you will mainly produce them yourself
This happens automatically (and non voluntarily) as soon as the dial has room to move on the wheel. 
Show example of all resources above one, and wheel moving to “spend” them to produce
Wheel only moves if arrows have a free space in front of them on both sides
Show example with refined resource at 3 when basic resources are all above one
Resources gained from actions must be gained in their entirety, it is gain X, not gain up to X
What a Turn looks like
Moving
On first move of game you will place pawn into empty village space in any village ( no resource cost)
On following turns you must always move your pawn 
Empty spot in same village for no cost
Empty space in any other village
You must pay one provision for every road traveled (no limit)
If you end in a village with other players, you must pay each player one basic resource (only applies if you move into a new village)
Moving player always pays, receiving player can decline
You must end in a spot where you can legally use one of the tradespeople
Visit tradespeople
After moving, visit one or both adjacent spots
Many are basic conversions, like pay thing to get thing
Some move glass bead on your estate board
When you reach top you expand estate by grabbing small estate board + 2 small forest tiles. Bead restarts at bottom and scores you points
THIS IS THEMATIC TO 13TH CENTURY GLASS BLOWING
Some tiles let you take actions based on what is in your estate, or adding stuff to estate, or removing stuff in your estate
Free action to destroy pond, field, or pasture (not forest)
Animals
Cattle
Kept in stable (2)
Pigs
Kept in uncleared forest (one)
Pasture can hold 3 of any one type
Building Buildings
All stored on, you guessed it, these buildings
Only 1 of each
Resource cost shown on left
Cost will always contain an amount of wood and/or brick, more powerful building require glass and other resources
Left column cost 0 glass, middle 1, right 2, large buildings 3
Pay cost, put in empty space in estate, immediately gain benefit
Beige background is instant bonus
Blue background is new free action (usually conversions)
Red background is passive effect
Gold background is endgame points (mainly on large buildings)
WALTER THER IS SO MANY BUILDINGS WHY DO I HAVE TO KEEP STOPPING FOR BEN TO READ THEM
Sign to the left of each row shows you the primary resource gained from that building type. You need meat? Look at the meat row
Travelling merchant
Choose a resource, you get 2, all other players optionally all gain 1
Can optionally spend one commodity to swap merchant with any tradesperson on board (only use for commodities)
Completing a job (scroll tiles)
Won’t be able to take these actions until you produce for the second time and hit your scroll
Lets you take a resource and take the top job from the stack
Place location jobs where symbols match
If tradesperson job, put it in village w/ that tradesperson symbol (if full next village clockwise)
You can move to a location and complete the job. Immediately draw another and place.
Make sure you have enough provisions to move away from the job site
Begging
Typically will only do if you run out of provisions
If you beg from village, move to center of village
If you beg from job site, just stay where you are
Gain 1 provision
Game end
Game end triggered by one or both of provision markers reaching the hourglass on the resource wheel.
All players now play 1 more turn (including person that triggered end
