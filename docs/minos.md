Minos Teach

In the ancient realm of Crete, we already the leaders of the of the 4 influential Minoan clans that will determine the fate of the city.

Unlike other civilizations, Minoans pride themselves on peace and prosperity, so we’ll be focusing on governance, developing,and cultivating our clans identity.

The game is played over 4 rounds, with a scoring occuring after the 2nd and 4th rounds.

Looking at the player boards, we’ve got an asymmetric power that we can improve over the course of the game to the left of our board, we have a number of things that we can build, in the top right we have an income track, and in the bottom right we have our supply of warriors. Beneath the bottom edge of our board will will tuck cards over the course of the game to get bonuses. The area beneath your board where cards are tucked is called your palace.

Round structure
Roll all the dice, reroll them all if there are 6 of the same value. Starting with the first player in turn order, we will draft one for each until we are out of dice.

Drafting Die
When you draft a die, you must place it into one of the action spaces. The action spaces are generally stronger to the left. When you place a die, you will use the dice pants of your color
 If there are no die there, your die goes furthest left.
If there are die, you die will go left of existing for it is a lower value than, to the right of dice it has a higher value than, and to the right of a die it ties with
If an action space is full, you cannot select it.
There are four colors of die, three of them have corresponding progress tracks. If your total placed die value is greater than 79 in any color, you will move up the corresponding progress track. Gray is wild, but a group can not be made up of only gray.
Red (Influence) track: number of cards you can add to your palace during income, also rewards coins, cards, and palace placements
Yellow (cultural) track: the power of your unique power and also gives goods and build action points. 
Blue (population) track: Weapon income and the number of VP you gain during scoring for warriors on the map. Also provides weapons and adds warriors to your reserves. Mention warriors set aside during set up

There are two types of currency (point out on action bonus spaces)
Coins are mainly earned through the income track on your player board
Weapons are mainly earned from the population track

The other bonus on action spaces is the ability to move up a track of your choice (the multi color pillar symbol)


Taking actions
Starting w/ the first player we will take the action of our hightest die on the board, removing it but leaving the pants. Once your action is resolved, you will remove the die pants from the action space, and then the next player in turn order will resolve the action of their hightest die. We will repeat this process until all actions are resolved.

After taking your die, but before resolving any acitons, you may instead forfeit the action to gain 2 coins.

Every action that you take could potentially trigger additional benefits from your royal traits. This is the crown symbol of cards tucked under your board. We start with one from set up. Royal traits can still be triggered even if you forfeit the action.

The Actions:
Prepare (red eyeball)
This action allows you to gain new cards. Each action point on the space you activate allows you to either draw one card from either the offer row or the top of the deck. The offer row does not refill until the end of your turn. There is no hand limit. 

Develop (blue tablet):
This action allows you to play cards. With each action point from the space you activate, you may play one card. If you have enough action points to play multiple cards, you must fully resolve a card before playing the next. Played cards are not discarded, keep them in your player area.
	Card anatomy
Coin cost to play the card is in the top left
A good is shown under the cost. You get a 3 coin discount if you have at least one of the depicted good. This does not stack for multiple goods. There are two types of goods. Permanent, which are the larger tiles, and temporary, which are the smaller tokens. If you use a temporary good to pay for a card discount, you lose the good afterwards. Permanent are permanent. If two different goods are shown you can get one or both discounts. If two of the same good are shown, you must have 2 of that good to get the 6 coin discount.
Top right of the card is VP. You only get this amount of VP if the card is tucked in your palace at the end of the game. Otherwise played cards are worth 1 VP for endgame scoring.
The large portion of the card depicts the instant effect when played.
The bottom of the card with the crown symbol in the banner is the royal trait. This is the passive bonus you will get if the card is tucked in your palace

Build (yellow hammer):
This action allows you to place cities, towers, and farms on the map, as well as build and advance ships on the trade routes. While goods only get you a one time discount when playing cards, when taking build actions you get discounts PER good. Each action point can be spend to do any of the following:
Build a city: Select a region w/ no other city that has at least one of your warriors. Pay the city’s printed cost, getting a discount of 3 silver for each brick. Place your leftmost available city on to the foundation tile in the region.
Build a tower: Select a region w/ one of your cities that doesnot already have a tower. Pay printed cost, discounts by red. Place leftmost tower on the map next to your city then gain the uncovered bonus from your player board.
Build a farm: Select a region with no farm and at least one of your warriors. If this is the 1st farm built, return one warrior from this region to your reserves, 2 for 2nd and so on. For each yellow resource you have, you may return one fewer warrior. Place top leftomost farm and gain uncovered bonus.
Build a ship: To do this, you must have at least one more city than you currently have ships. Since you start with one city, you may always build your first ship. Building a ship consists of 2 steps:
Pay depicted cost discounted by wood
Sleect a trade route without one of your ships, then place your leftmost ship on the lowest space, paying the depicted cost (discounted by green). If you cannot pay the cost of the trade route space the ship would go in, you cannot build the ship.
Advance ship: To do this, you must already have a ship on a trade route, and must be able to pay the printed cost of the space you’re moving to. For each green resource you have you get a discount of 1 coin. Whenever you get to the second space of a trade route, choose and take one of the available trade route bonus tiles. 4th space gives you a red bonus tile, 5th space gains you the VP shown.

Expand (green dude):
Allows you to place warriors in regions you have cities, and to move your warriors on the map. Each action point allows you to do the following:
Place one warrior from your reserves into any region containing one of your cities
Move one warrior from one region to an adjacent region.

Wild (multicolor snake):
You can use wild actions as any other action in the game. You can never split wild action points into two different main actions. Royal traits for other actions besides wild are not triggered by you taking the wild action. Ex: If you choose to build w/ your wild action, you do not trigger the build action royal traits you have.

Royal Traits:
Will either be triggered when taking the depicted action, or when retrieving the depicted die. Any traits triggered must be done before, between, or after actions. Each effect must be performed in it’s entirety before moving to the next.

Extra actions:
You may use each of the extra actions at most once during your turn
Spend a weapon to ove a warrior to an adjacent region
Spend a weapon to gain a temporary good of the same type as depicted in a region where you have a warrior
Use a trade bonus tile, gaining all benefits then returning it to the box
Discard cards for an equal amount of coins
Exchange 3 temporary goods for a matching permanent good. If there is no permanent good in the face up stacks on the main board, you cannot exchange temp goods for that type of good.
Gaining goods bonuses. When permanent goods are gained, they can gain you income track steps. 
First good of a type is one step
2nd good of a type is 2 stps
3rd good is 1 step, and top card of 2nd age deck
4th good is 2 steps, no further bonuses
Battle “sea peoples” in a region where you have at least one warrior. Spend as much weaponry as shown on the top sea peoples tile, return one warrior from that region to your reserves, and gain the depicted benefit. Then place the sea peoples tile next to your board. 

Objectives (vases):
As soon as you meet the condition on a vase tile, place one of your objective markers to cover the space depicting the highest VP and gain that VP. No one else may place on that space. If two people meet the condition at the same time, they both gain the VP w/ both players putting their markers on different spaces.

Scoring:
Scoring occurs after the 2nd and 4th rounds. After the mid game scoring we will also witch to a new deck of cards. Here is what we’ll score:
Farms: 2/4/8/14 VP for 1/2/3/4 farms placed
Region: Score in numerical order. Check both of these:
Dominance: most warriors
Prescense: At least 1 warrior, but not majority
According to their position on the blue (population track), players score the right bonus for dominance, and the left for presence. If players are tied for dominance, they only score presence. Additional towers built may grant extra VP for dominance.
Only in the 4th round will we score the following:
Sea peoples battles: Remove all remaining lvl 1 sea peoples tiles from the map. For every tile remainiung on the map from lowest to highest region number, the player w/ the most warriors in that region may choose to battle those ea people. If there is a ttie the player w/ the most weaponry wins the tie. If most warriors chooses not toi battle, the next player can choose to and so on.
Resource scoring: add up remaining coins, weapons, cards in hand, divide by 5 for VP
Palace: # of VP on tucked palace cards
VP below city and ships built
