Trickerion Teach

We’re rival magicians. The famous magician Dhaalgard is retiring, and we have 5 weeks to prove to him that we’re the best magician around and most worthy to inherit his secrets, including the trickerion stone, rumored to give Dhaalgard supernatural powers

At it’s core, this is a worker placement game

Over the course of the game, you’ll:

Buy tricks (Yellow downtown)
Buy the stuff we need to perform them (Orange market row)
Practice the tricks (Red workshop)
Stage them in the theater (Theater), and then perform them for fame points

At the end of the 5th week (round), whoever has the most fame wins

There are 4 different categories of illusions in Trickerion
Mechanical (gear)
Spiritual (swirl)
Escape (chain)
Optical (eye)

We’ll start the game by picking a magician that prefers tricks of one of these schools

Start of the week
At the start of every week, we’ll roll these 6 dice and place them on the square spaces in the Downtown (Yellow) area
Starting with the second week, we’ll rearrange the turn order track so whoever has the least fame is first, most is last
You can then advertise, to gain 2 fame. You place your poster on the turn order slot you occupy, paying the cost

Placing workers: 
You have a minimum of 3 character discs that are workers you can place in 4 different places around the main board.
Downtown: Where you get new workers, money, and tricks
Market Row: Where you buy materials to practice tricks
Workshop (your playerboard): Where you actually practice your tricks
Theater: where you stage (heh) and perform your tricks

Each character disk has a half circle on the bottom w/ a value and lightning bolt
Biggest number is you, the magician
Next biggest is your specialist
Smallest is your apprentice

The board has circular areas where you can place your character discs. Each space has a small number below it, which represent action points. The more action points, the more stuff you get to do
Action points are cumulative, so placing your magician disk (the 3) on top of a spot with a 2, means you get 5 action points to spend in that space

Action programming
To decide where your characters will go, you have to set them in advance
You do this by placing an assignment card face down below each character disk
This process is down simultaenously (and since they’re played face down, secrectly)
Everyone will flip and reveal
A character without a disk will not get placed
In turn order, we will take turns placing one character out onto the board into their pre-designated spot until everyone has placed all of their character
Using characters like this will cost you wages at the end of the round
If you do not think you can pay (or for any other reason) you can treat a character as idle and just flip over their assignment card instead of placing them
They will not be activated this turn, but you will not have to pay them

BACK TO THE ACTION LOCATIONS
Downtown (Where you get new workers, money, and tricks)
Learn a trick (top middle): 3 action points
Grab a trick card if it’s category matches one of the die faces
You can also grab a trick of your magician’s preferred category
So if a trick category is not your preferred type, or not shown on one of the die, it cannot be selected
Cards have a fame threshold in the bottom right, which you must meet to be able to learn a trick. This value will either be 1 or 16
You must have at least this many fame points to learn a trick, but if you fall short, you can pay the difference in coins
You DO NOT have to pick the card off the top of the pile. You can dig through that deck and grab whatever trick you want
If you grab a trick that matches a die face, you then flip the die to it’s X side
If you grab a tick that matches your preferred category but not one of the die, you choose which die to flip to the x side
The trick goes into your workshop, and you assign one of your symbol markers to it (the solid card suit token w/ no magic category symbols). If you are out of slots in your workshop, you can always remove a trick from there. You then remove all associated tiles and return the trick to the downtown board
Hire another characte (top left)r: 3 action points
Available characters are shown on the dice
Just like getting a new trick, if you get a new character, flip the corresponding die to it’s x face
Place the new character disk on top of the one that you used to buy it so you don’t get mixed up with it on your player board
You can only hire one of each specialist
Withdraw money from bank (top right): 3 action points
Choose the amount you want, gain it, then flip the die to it’s X face
Reroll die (bottom right): 1 action point
Reroll any one die in this area
Set die (bottom left): 2 action points:
Set a die to whatever face you want in this seciton
Market Row (Where you buy materials to practice tricks)
Trick require materials to perform them (show cost on a trick)
Buy material (furthest left): 1 action point
Choose an available component, and buy up to 3 instances of them
Materials have a dot on the bottom (and all share a color) for how many coins each material is. One dot equals one coin each, three dots equals 3 coins each
The board basically represents the catalog of available goods. When you buy components, they are not removed from the board, but gained directly from the supply
You can only own up to 3 of each type of component. They’re stored on your board and stacked by type
When you buy, you can spend extra action points to bargain the price down. This is attached to the same ation space and costs 1 action point.
This does not decrease the price per unit, only the overall price
Can’t bargain down to zero, will always pay at least one coin
Slow order for the market (far right): 1 action point
Goods queued up with this action will appear in the store next week
Place the new component on the board. The slot it is placed in is the component it will replace when it arrives in the shop
Quick order for the market (middle): 2 action points
Goods selected with this action will be available for immediate purchase
Place the new component in the single slot, replacing one already there if applicable
The component is now available to purchase this week
Items in the quick order slot cost an extra coin per unit to purchase
The quick order slot gets cleared out at the end of the week
Workshop (your player board) (Where you actually practice your tricks)
Preparing a trick
When you place a disk here, if you own all the components a trick requires (and in the right quantities), you can then prep the trick.
You spend the action points shown on the trick, then populate the trick with the trick marker tiles equal to the number shown on the trick (matching the suit of the symbol marker placed whenever the trick was originally gained).
If there are already markers on a trick, you can’t prep it
With the setup for the beginner game, our starting trick is already prepped
When a trick is prepped, it just checks to see that you have the components, they are NOT consumed
Specialists (your side board)
These are chosen during set up, beginner game setup has assigned us all one
Each specialist has a unique action you can take (they are conveniently not named on the cards)
Engineer (wrench)
Allows you to move a trick from your board to hers for 1 action point (or exchange tricks already in her slot)
If you prep a trick on her board, you get one bonus trick marker
Manager (stopwatch)
Allows you to move components to his card, or swap them with components on your board
Components here are treated as having a bonus one for free. So if there are 2 glass on him, it counts as 3 glass. So if this is the case you couldn’t buy more glass, because the component limit is 3
Assistant (bow)
Extra slot for an apprentice (another character/worker)
In any of the 3 major locations we’ve talked about, Downtown, the Market row, and the workshop, you can spend one trickerion shard when you place your character for an extra action point. You can not do this in the…
Theater (where you stage (heh) and perform your tricks
The theater represents various different theaters, think of it as one of many buildings that you can perform magic
Placement circles are grouped in column by day (listed at the bottom of the row)
If you place a character in a certain day’s slot, you have locked that day down, and no other player can place a character in that column for the rest of that week
Any other characters you place in the theater have to be placed into the column you’ve already placed in, so no double dipping
Again, you can’t spend trickerion shards here for action action points like in the other locations
Top hot slots are for placing magicians only
Staging a trick so that it’s ready to perform (top left): 1 action point
You spend one action point to move a trick token from your workshop to one of the performance cards
Think of these cards as playbills that list the various trick that will be performed in a single show
Each trick you stange on a card must be unique, so you could not have multiple of the same trick token (because these would be from the same trick)
When you place the token, the corner representing that trick’s category of magic must be touching one of the circles on the card
If you stage a trick so that the symbol inside the circle lines up with another trick, those tricks are now linked
This gets your extra fame or coins (left reminder card) depending on the level of the trick
If there is a trickerion shard in the circle where this occurred, any player with a trick token in there gets one shard. If both tricks are yours you still only get one shard
Reschedule action (top right): one action point
Lets you move an already placed trick token to an empty space on a card (either the same card or a different one)
If you link tricks while doing this, they don’t count for any bonuses we just talked about
Magician only performance slots (time to put on a show):
New phase that happens after all characters have been placed and all turns are over
Turn order is ignored for resolution of this phase, we go left to right by day in the theater columns
A player gets to choose a performance card that has at least one of their trick markerst on it to perform and performs that show
Every trick on the card will be performed, whether it belongs to you or another player
Players will earn the fame and coins from their corresponding tricks in that show
Yield modifiers
Some days are better or worse to place on. 
Thursday has a negative modifier of minus one coin and minus one fame
If you place any worker in the Thursday column, and any of your tricks get performed in shows at any time that week, you receive the negative modifier for any rewards of those tricks. You can’t go into the negative
Conversley, Sunday gives you a positive modifier for any of your tricks performed on any day
So thursday gives you bonus action points, but a worse yield modifier, where Sunday gives you less action points, but a better yield modifier. Friday and Saturday both give no bonus to action points or yield modifier.
If your trick gets performed, but you have no characters in the theater, your yield modifier is the same as the performing magicians
Performing magician bonuses
Why perform the show if everyone’s tricks get payed out you ask?
The right reminder card shows the bonuses the performing magician gets
1 fame for every trick link in the show
The reward shown if you have that additional character “backstage” in that column
Whatever bonus is listed at the bottom of the performance card
When a trick is performed, the marker is removed from the card and returned from the player’s supply, NOT back to the trick card

ROUND END
Wages
When the weeks performances have ended, you need to pay wages
The slot for that token on your board shows what you have to pay (if you used that character this round)
If you can’t pay, you lose 2 fame for each coin you can’t pay in wages
You have to pay if you can
Clean up 
Take character disks back from the main board
If anyone was hired, add them to your board
Any goods in the ordered area of market row replace the appropriate goods
Any quick ordered goods are removed
Performance cards move forward like a conveyer belt, and a new one is flipped from the deck into the empty slot
A performance card is removed from the game when it falls off the conveyor belt, and any trick tokens still on it are returned to the players supply
Everyone who advertised gets their poster back
Round counter advances
Reroll and place dice
Take your assignment cards back
Time for another week

END GAME
1 fame for each leftover shard
1 fame for every 3 coins
2 fame for each apprentice
3 fame for each specialist
Initiative order breaks ties
