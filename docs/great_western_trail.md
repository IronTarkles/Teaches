Great Western trail teach

We're ranchers in the west who want to make their fortunes selling cattle to the east. The flow of the game is working down the trail to get up to the top to sell your cattle at market. Over the course of a game, you can expect to sell cattle 5-7 times.

Overview
Set up player boards: We're going to block off all these spaces with disks in our player colors. These are all upgrades that we’ll be able to unlock over the course of the game, but we’ll get back to that.
Brief overview of board. Talk about buildings, outlaws, and hazards. Kansas City, start of trail
This game has deck builder elements where you'll be using the cards in your hand to do stuff. Cows have breeding values in the top corner that will be important later.

Turn structure:
On your turn you'll do 3 things. Move, take actions in the space you land in, and then draw up to your handsize. There are spaces on your player hard to remind you of how these work
Movement:
Your base movement is 3, but you can increase that by getting these 2 upgrades. You must always move forward at least 1 space, and you can never go backwards. It takes one movement point per location you move across. Locations are tiles, any empty building site does not require movement to cross. You can share spaces, and Kansas City stops all movement, you can't move past it with extra movement. The space where you end up is the one you activate during the next part of your turn

Green and black hands: These are shown on tiles you move over and indicate fees that you have to pay. Green is one, black is two. Hazard or outlaw tiles get paid to the bank, player tile fees get paid to that player.

Not being able to pay does not stop your movement. Pay what you can, if anything, and keep moving. Never have to pay retroactivly. So if you land on a space you can't pay for but then earn money, you don't have to then pay the fee you missed

Activating the tile you landed on:
If it's neutral or yours, activate either all location actions (actions on tile), or one auxillary action.

Local actions can be done in any order, you don't have to do them all. Some have a cost, some have a slash for either/or, most have 1-3 options

Auxillary actions are shown on the side of your board. You have a couple unlocked by default, the rest can be made available by upgrades

If you land on a hazard, outlaw, or tile owned by another player, you can only take one auxillary action.

So you want to try and stop on neutral buildings or ones you own to get the most out of your turn

There is one space you can end your turn on that we haven't talked about, Kansas City. This is where you send your cattle to market.

When you reach Kansas City, you must carry out the 5 steps in order. Move your dude from each space to the next as you complete them

Phase 1-3: Foresights: pick a tile and place it. Hazards and outlaws go in the next lowest numbered space in the appropriate area. 

Workers get placed in their area following a few rules. Must be placed in the row with the job market token left to right. When the job market token would be covered move it down. This is the timer, when it reaches the end, the end of the game is triggered. Additionally when it reaches the halfway point, the cattle market is refilled.

Phase 4: income: Reveal your whole hand. Calculate your total breeding value by adding up the values from every unique cow in your hand. Duplicates will not be counted. Then discard all cards from your hand

You can increase your breeding value by using certificates. There are temporary certificates that you have a tracker for on your board, or permanent ones that you unlock through upgrading

Phase 5 - Deliver: you must now pick a city to deliver to based on your total breeding value (equal or lower). Can't deliver to a city with your disk on it, with the exception of Kansas City and New York. Both of these are worth negative points so not a great idea to do a lot. Once you pick a city, select a disk from your board to place. Keep in mind the color space you take the disk from must match the color City you deliver to (black or white). You will then gain any bonuses shown on the tile, and may gain or lose points at the end of the game 
Bonuses in green arrows aren't triggered unless you have a disk in both locations
Lastly, check to see if you need to pay transport costs. If your train is directly at the city or further up the track, it's free. If your train is further back, pay 1 for each crossing symbol between you and the destination city
Move your herder to the start of the trail horse space
Refill the forsight spaces from the appropriate bags
