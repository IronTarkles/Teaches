Theme:
We are members of a psychological society started by Sigmund Freud devoted to psychoanalysis (or study of the unconscious mind). 

As members of this society, we aim to come up with new therapeutic techniques, grow our clientele, and become Freud’s most distinguished contemporary. To do this we will discuss ideas with peers, compile notes, and publish theory. To do all this we’ll also need a lot of coffee

Overview:
The game is played over a number of rounds. On your turn, you will chose from one of 3 options:
State Ideas
Recall Ideas
Treat Clients
Play will continue like this until Freud’s reputation marker (the gray heart looking thing) moves onto the watch space of the reputation track, triggering the end of the  game. Once this happens, we will finish out the current round, and then play one more round. At the end of that, the player with the most victory points wins the game

GENERAL CONCEPTS 
INSIGHT:
Each player has a big ol 3 color wheel. This is where you will keep track of your insight. There are 3 colored wedges for each quality, and
Three rings, one for each level:
Minor - diamond shaped
Median - hex shaped
Major - circle shaped

There is also a center reserve, which you will draw new insight from. While in the reserve, insight does not have a quality or level. You start with white insights in your pool, but can unlock playered colored ones throughout the game

Certain effects allow you to generate an insight. To generate insight, move them from your reserve to the corresponding areas. If you would generate insight, but do not have any in your reserve, you may choose to remove one from anywhere on your dial and use that one instead.

Certain effects that look like arrows will let you move insight. Whe you increase level you can’t go from 0 to 1. 

You pay insight by moving it to your reserve. You may always use a higher level insight to pay a lower level cost, but there is no “making change”. So you could pay a minor cost with a median insight of the same color.

There are generic colorless insight shapes that refer to any insight of the depicted level. There is a spot on your playerboard where you can trade a minor, median, and major insight for a heart shaped box.

GENERAL CONCEPT: REPUTATION:
On the city board is a reputation track that does two different things. Any time a player one goes up, so does Freud’s. Him reaching the pocketwatch triggers the end of the game. Finish out round + one more.

When you gen a reputation (looks like a medal), first move Freud’s marker and then yours. If any marker crosses a line with the little face on the track, this make’s Freud’s meeple move locations, and this can happen multiple times in a turn.


This icon triggers the reputation track. When this happens you score points/coffee show at the zone above the track in the section where your marker is.Then look at the zone below the track. You can perform any one action from Freud’s section or lower.

Just remember, gaining reputation and triggering the reputation track are different things.

GENERAL CONCEPT

Two major resources on playerboard. Heart shaped boxes are mainly used to cure clients. Conversions in middle of board. Coffee is used for a lot, there are conversions in the bottom left of the playerboard. When you would downgrade and insight, you can pay a coffee to ignore it. You can pay 2 coffee to level up an insight or change it’s color. Coffee can also be used to gain a bright idea token, which we’ll talk about more.

MAJOR ACTIONS
On your turn, you can do one of three actions. Here’s how to 

STATE IDEAS
Ideas are the little speech bubbles in the bottom left of your playerboard. To perform this action you will grab 1 or 2 ideas and place them onto an empty idea space on the meeting table, pointing the tail at the action you want to perform. Placing one idea lets you do the action once, 2 ideas lets you do it twice. You can’t point the tails at an action that you have other ideas pointing at already.

You can substitute a bright idea for an idea token. You could even use 2 bright ideas and no idea token. These will go back to the supply at end of turn, where normal ideas stay on the meeting table. After performing your actions, you advance your inkpot

INKPOT
Your inkpot will move clockwise along it’s track equal to the value shown on the row of the meeting board where you took your action, performing the inkpot effect where it ends movement. Bottom left of playerboard reminds you that for each bright idea token spent, you can modify this moevent +/- 1, down to a minimum of one.
Three spaces aligned with insight will generate the insight shown, and then resolve the effects of every notebook tile in that row in any order. If the token has been removed from the end of the row, you will get the effect shown there too.
Space on the left activates reputation track (not gain rep)
Top space of the 4 stack has you pick a column with no idea above it, and then resolve every notebook tile in that column. If the token has been removed from below the column, get the effect show there as well.
When you move your inkpot over the printed gain idea symbol, remove the leftmost idea token and add it to your reserve

MEETING TABLE ACTIONS


Right lets you generate one minor insight of each quality
Left lets you perform 2 elevations and one transfer (in any order)


These 3 all let you pay coffee to grab a notebook tile
Left: Grab the tile from above column
Mid: Grab the tile from above column and activate the banner effect
Right: Grab the tile from above column, activate the banner effect, activate main effect
Tiles get placed into leftmost empty space of any row on your playerboard (place so that banner side is facedown)
Third tile in each row has a cured client requirement. First symbol requires 0, second symbol 1, and last symbol 2.
Tiles slide down to fill. This happens immediately. So if you took the action twice you’ll always have a full tileset available.
When a row is completed , remove the insight and add it to the reserve on your tile. Same for a column.

Right: Draw the top card of the research deck. Then you may swap any card in your hand with one of the faceup research cards in the display
Left: Play up to two research cards or publish a treatise
Cards stay in front of you after resolved, location tags on them are added to your overall tag count
Treatise: 
To do this you must have a player colored insight on your dial
All of the treatises in the display are available, pick one to publish

You can use your own research cards and cite other players research cards to supply all the needed color cards, but the leftmost card with the icon must come from your played cards. You will lose access to any tags on cards that come from your played cards.
Once all cards are gathered, arrange them in the correct order and place the tile over them. Remove a player colored insight from your dial, placing it on the tile. Score the points in the center. Location tags on the tile are now yours.
To cite research from another player, grab the rightmost card from one of their treatises and add it to the cards you're collecting for the treatise. They receive 2 points and a bright idea. Can take multiple cards from the same player, and can take from multiple players, but you can only take the rightmost card, not leaving any gaps.

These actions let you move around the city. Lets talk about the city first.
City is divided into 3 districts. 2 locations in each district, identified by tags.
Each location may hold any number of figures

3 possible location effects, applied when you move to that location
Each location has 3 bonus slots
Each district has 4 bonus slots

Left action: Move your professor up to 2 locations clockwise around city, or move them to the same location as Freud. If you choose the latter, you must start in a different location that Freud.
Right action: Move Freud up to 3 spaces clockwise.
After moving yourself or Freud, you will resolve the effect of the location where that figure ends up to a maximum of 5 times. To determine this, either count:
Number of figures in that location
Number of that location’s tags you have
There is a reminder in the middle of the board that you can spend a bright idea to get 2 extra actions here, but whatever combination you pay, the max is still 5.

RECALL IDEAS
Instead of placing ideas and taking actions, you can recall your ideas. You must have 1 idea on the meeting table to do this
Count the number of meeting table spaces you have ideas on and gain that amount of coffee.
Remove all your ideas from the table and place them back in your supply.
Then choose either the location with your professor or the location with Freud. You will then claim a location bonus or a district bonus.
Location bonus: Choose an empty location bonus slot and gain that effect. Then move the topmost token from that district’s color stack and place it on the option that you chose to cover it. Placing the token with the reputation icon earns you a reputation.
District bonus: To do this you must have a player colored insight on your dial. Count the number of location tags matching the color of the district. Place your player colored insight marker on the number equal to or lesser than that value, gaining the bonus shown. Then move the topmost token from the district onto that slot.
Once a district is out of tokens, no location or district bonuses can be taken there.

TREAT CLIENTS

This is your office where clients and dreams will go. Dreams up top, clients on bottom.
When you treat a client, you may treat one or both in any order.
To treat a client, 
look at the effect of the topmost dream. You must pay the depicted insight.
Resolve the effect of the dream. Heart symbols are therapy points
For each therapy point, move the marker on that side of the office one space to the left
If you move over this space, immediately trigger catharsis.
Catharsis will remove the client’s grief layer, but more on that in a minute
Dream card is then removed from the game.
When gaining therapy points, if you hit 0, you have cured the client, more on that later.
If you would gain “extra” therapy points pushing you into the negative, you gain that many heart shaped boxes.
Some manifest dreams have a symbol in the top right. If that symbol matches the one of the client’s grief layer, you will gain a heart shaped box when resolving that dream.

CATHARSIS:
Resolve the bonus on the top left of the grief layer card.
Starting grief layer cards also show the grad cap symbol. Removing this grief layer unlocks your second office room.
Removing the grief layer unlocks the abilities on the bottom of the card. Even though the client is not yet cured, this ability is now active.
Points are only scored when client is cured.

When a client is cured, you move them to your tableau. Their ability and tags are still active.
Routine clients provide passive bonus and tags
Case study clients provide end game scoring
All of these are explained on one of your player aides.
If there are still any dream cards in your office when a client is cured, remove them. From the game.

END OF TURN
You may use heart shaped boxes to produce therapy points
This can trigger catharsis or cure a client
Take on a new client for each empty office room you have
Take one of the patients from the display and add it to an office. Display is refilled immediately. 
Draw a latent dream and put it in space above the client’s room
Draw a manifest dream from the display or the top card of the deck. This display is refilled immediately. Place it on top of the latent dream.
Place the therapy marker on the space matching the amount of green hearts shown on the card

LOCATION GOALS
7 location goal tiles are between the main boards
When you meet the condition shown on a tile, you must immediately claim it
Gain the reputation, then place the tile face down in your tableau. Tags are now yours.

END OF GAME
When Freud’s marker reaches pocketwatch, end of game is triggered.
Player who caused this to happen gains 3 points. 
Complete the current round, then one additional round. 
In final round, you do not take on any new clients

POINTS
Score points shown on reputation marker space
(shown on end of reputation track): Player who is furthest along the track scores 2 points for each of their completed treatises, and 2 points for each cured client. 2nd farthest on track gets 1 point for each. In case of a tie, the player on bottom is considered further ahead.
Check number of districts with your colored insights. Score 4/10/18 points for presence in 1/2/3 districts (shown in middle of board).
Count number of rows on playerboard that are full of notebook tiles. Score 1/5/6 points for 1/2/3 being completed. (shown on player board top right)
Score points for unique location tags you have (shown on bottom of board)
Case study cards
Heart shaped boxes convert to 2 points each
Coffee converts to bright ideas 3:1
1 point for each bright idea
