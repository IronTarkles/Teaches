## Gameplay

Each players set of play cards is called a team. Teams generally remain with the player throughout the game and are not redistribuited.

There are initial cards (1-7 in 4 suits) and reinforcement cards which have a variety of effects. Each team begins the game consisting of 7 initial cards and 2 reinforcement cards.

Each season consists of the following phases:

- Rule reveal
- Hand Selection
- Main
- End

### Rule reveal phase

The special rules for the season are revealed using the gold season cards. Some gold season cards require actions at this phase.

The rules for the 1st and 5th season are visible at the start, and are the same every game

### Hand selection phase

Each player selects the cards they will use for the current season from their team. The number of cards to select varies by season and is indicated on the Silver Season Card. Place the unused cards face down under your Lodge Card in the Lodge space.

### Main phase

At thge start of each season's main phase, the player with the start card must play it. The start card is the weakest card with no number. The player with this card must play it at the start of the main phase as a single. The next player can play any number but cannot play a set or run.

Other players take turns clockwise either playing or passing

- Playing: Play cards from your hand following these rules
    - Played cards must be of the same type as the previous play
    - Played cards must be of the same quantity as the previous play
    - Played cards must have a higher number than the previously played cards
    - If you already have cards played in front of you, just play the new ones on top of them

- Card play types:
    - Single
    - Set
    - Run (have to be same color, minimum of 2 cards)

- Passing
    - If you can't or don't want to play, you can instead pass
    - PLace your lodge card with the pass side up in front of you. If you have played cards in front of you already, put the lodge card on top of them. 
    - A player who has passed skips their turn until the field is reset

- Resetting
    - When all but one player has passed, the field is reset.
    - Each player moves all their played cards to their lodge space, placing them on top of other cards in the lodge. Keep these cards face up to distinguish them from cards that haven't been played. The lodge card then goes on top of these cards with the summary side up.
    - The player who did not pass leads with whatever they want

- End of main phase
    - The first player to get rid of their hand becomes 1st place for the season. The last cards played by this player remain on the field until the field is reset. Skip that player's turn and continue play. If no one can beat the final card played by the player that runs out of cards, the field is reset and the next player in turn order leads out.
    - When a second player runs out of cards the main phase ends immediately

### End phase

    - Receives the gold season card for that season and gains the VP indicated on it
    - Receives the start card and places it in front of them
    - Draws 1 reinforcement card from the draw pile and adds it to their team
