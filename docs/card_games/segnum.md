## Overview

Get rid of all the cards in your hand to score points. You'll also have pieces that you can use to modify the value of cards in your hand to get rid of them quicker. At the end of 3 rounds, whoever has the most points wins the game

### Deck makeup

6 cards of each 0-9

### Setup

| Turn order | Cards | Segments |
|------------|-------|----------|
| 1 | 12 | 1 |
| 2 | 12 | 1 |
| 3 | 12 | 2 |
| 4 | 12 | 2 |
| 5 | 12 | 3 |

Stack up the rest of the segments in the center of the table. Any cards not dealt are removed and note used in the game

## Flow of the game

The start player will play either a single card or set of matching rank cards from their hand, then in turn order you will have to beat what was played or pass. Only singles and sets, there are no runs in this game

### Playing cards

When there are no cards on the field, any amount of cards can be lead

When following, you must either:
- Play the same amount of cards, but a higher rank
    - A pair of 3s could beat a pair of 2s
- Play a higher number of cards regardless of rank (you can only play one more card than what was played previoulsy.)
    - So a pair of 7s could be beaten by triple 1's

### Using segments

All the numbers in the game are digital numbers that can be changed to different value through the use of blacking out parts of the number, or lighting up parts of the number with segments.
- Only one color of segment may be used on a card, but you can use any amount of segments. So you could not use the blue and black side of segments on the same number
- You can use segments on as many cards that you're playing as you like, as long as the end result is cards of all the same value
- Each card shows on the side what it can be changed into and how many segements of what type it will take

### Passing

If you can't or don't want to play, you can pass.
- Grab 2 segments from the supply
- You have a max of 7 segments
- It is a soft pass, you can always jump back in

Consecutive passes except for the last played result in the trick being cleared and that player playing whatever they want from their hand to start the next trick

## End of the round

The round will end whenever 2 players have played all the cards in their hands.

### Scoring

- First player to go out gets 7 points, the second to go out gets 5 points.
- Cards left in players hands are worth -1 point each
- Every 2 segments left is worth -1 point (rounding down)
- Any player with 0 segments remaining gets 3 points, regardless of cards left in hand

## End of the game

At the end of 3 rounds, the highest score wins. If there is a tie, whoever scored the most points in the final round out of tied players wins the game.
