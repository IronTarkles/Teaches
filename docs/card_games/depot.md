## Overview

All of the cards are packages and we're trying to deliver them all. Play all of the cards in your hand to go out first and win

### Deck Makeup

- 1 - 13 cards
- 2 - 12 cards
- 3 - 11 cards
- 4 - 10 cards
- 5 - 10 cards
- 6 - 9 cards
- 7 - 8 cards
- 8 - 7 cards

### Setup

Deal 9 cards each for 3p & 4p, 8 cards for 5p

Remaining cards are placed as a deck in the center of the table

Reveal 3 cards for 3p, or 4 cards for 4 & 5p in a row called the storage. Stack like values

## Flow of the game

On your turn you either play cards or pass

### Playing cards

What you can play is dictated by what is in storage

- You can always play a single, because there will always be a single number in storage
- Sets of cards can only be played if there is a set in storage. So if there is a pair of cards of the same value in storage, you could also play pairs. If there were a triple in storage, you could play a pair or a triple
- Same goes for runs. If there is a 2 card run in storage, you could play a 2 card run. If there were a 3 card run in storage, you could play a 2 or 3 card run
- Those are the only types of melds. Singles, sets, and runs

When playing, you must beat what has been played previously, following a few rules

- If there is only one card, a higher number beats it
- If there is more than one card:
    - Regarldess of the rank of cards, a meld with more cards will be considered stronger
    - If the number of cards is the same, the meld with the higher total value is stronger
        - So a pair of 4's total value is 8. A two card run of 3-4 would not beat it (since the value is 7), but a two card run of 4-5 would beat it (since the value is 9)

Every time cards are played, put the previously played cards in the discard so only the highest meld is on the table

### Passing

If the player can't or doesn't want to play cards, they can pass. They folllow these steps:

- Take note of the total number of cards in storage
- Choose a number in storage and add all cards of that number to your hand
- That player MAY take a single card from their hand and add it to the storage (must be a different number than what was grabbed)
- If the amount of cards in storage is less than previously noted, refill from the deck until full

If everyone passes except for the last player to play, the trick is over.

- Discard any cards in play
- Draw a single card from the deck and add it to the storage area
    - So every trick that is cleared will result in there being an additional card in storage
- The person who was last to play leads the next trick, playing whatever they want (within the confines allowed by storage)

## End of the game

You can play the game as a single round, or over 3 rounds

If playing a single round, whenever someone runs out of cards in their hand, they win the game

If playing multiple rounds, after someone runs out of cards:

- Count cards remaining in players hands to assign 2nd, 3rd, etc (higher total value if same amount of cards)
- The player who came in last grabs the highest value card and puts it in their score pile
- The next player takes the card with the second highest value from storage and puts it in their score pile
- This continues through the player who placed 2nd taking the lowest value card in storage
- If there is no card with a lower value in storage, the player takes the same card as the person before them
- If this is not possible, the player does not take a card

At the end of 3 rounds, whoever has the fewest points is the winner
