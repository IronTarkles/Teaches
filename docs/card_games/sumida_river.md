# Overview
3-4 player shedding game, where it is must not follow meld type. The deck is a pyramid deck of 3-10. So there are 3-3s, 4-4s and so on. There are only 2 suits, red and black. For even numbers, the colors are split evenly. For odd numbers, there are more black than red.

# Setup
- Give each player 2 red wild cards and 2 black wild cards
- These cards are placed in front of each player, they will not automatically be a part of the hand
- Put meld cards onto the table in ascending order
- Deal 13 cards to each player

# Round Structure
Rounds are made up of 2 phases. The trade phase and the shedding phase

### Trade Phase
- After everyone looks at hands, simultaneously declare if they want to keep or trade their hand. You can only trade if you have wild cards on the table in front of you
- To declare, count down and all put thumbs up for keep or thumbs down for trade
- If a player says keep, they keep their hand and are out for the rest of the trade phase
- If multiple players say trade, those players will add a wild from the cards on the table to their hand and pass the entire hand to the next clockwise player who also declared trade
- If only one player declared trade, they may add any number of wilds to their hand, but do not pass their hand after
- If any trading happened, the trade phase occurs again with any players who traded hands again declaring to trade or keep

### Shedding Phase
Goal is to get rid of all the cards in your hand and "shed out"
- Start player is the one with the red 3 (or lowest points if not in play)
- Clockwise players will take turns playing valid melds into the trick. The legal types of melds are on the meld cards.
- Once a meld has been played, it may not be played again that trick.
- Subsequent melds must play the same lowest number, or a higher lowest number
    - Examples:
    - Player A plays a pair of black 5's
    - Player B plays a run of red 5, 6
    - Player C plays a single Red 5
- When everyone passes besides whoever played the last meld, the trick is cleared and all the melds are now valid again. That player then plays any valid meld

### Special Melds
- Red triple and black run of 3
    - These 2 melds may contain a card of the opposite color
- Black four of a kind
    - After playing this meld, the player may end the trick immediately.
    - The player then clears all the cards from the trick and starts a new trick with all melds available.
- Red Run of 4
    - After playing this meld, the player may discard any card in hand if they have at least 2 cards remaining

### Wilds
- Wild cards count as wild value, BUT NOT color
- Any number of wild cards may be used in a played meld
- A wild is ignored for the purpose of meet or beat on the next players turn
    - Example: A run of 10, 9, Wild. The following player would need to meet or beat a 9, as the wild value of 8 is ignored.
- When a meld is ONLY wilds, they are considered to be the lowest valule card possible in that situation
- Wilds on the table in front of a player are not available to play during the shedding phase, only those added in the trading phase

# Scoring
Whenever a player sheds out of cards, they score points and are out of the round. The remaining players continue playing until only one remains. The last player in gets 0 points

| Place | 3 Players | 4 Players |
|-------|-----------|-----------|
| 1st | 2 | 3 |
| 2nd | 1 | 2 |
| 3rd | 0 | 1 |
| 4th | | 0 |

### End of the round
Play number of rounds equal to players. Re-deal all the cards, but set aside any wilds that were played in the previous round and remove them from the game. Wilds in front of a plyer carry over from round to round.

# End of the Game
The player with the most points after rounds equal to player count wins. If tied, the player with the fewest wilds left in front of them wins.
