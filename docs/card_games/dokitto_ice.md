# Overview
We are members of the ice cream lovers club. We're going to an ice cream festival, but the club is on a very strict budget. 3 scoops is the max, everyone knows 4 is too many! This is a must follow trick taker with no trump.

# Set up

|                   |   |   |   |   |
|-------------------|---|---|---|---|
| Number of players | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 |
| Number of flavors | 3 | 3 | 4 | 5 |
| Dealt Cards       | 6 | 8 | 10 | 13 |

- Flavors not used go back in box
- Shuffle flavor tokens face down and arrange in stacks with toppings nearby
- Every player grabs an ice cream cone
- Deal out number of cards above

# Round Structure
- Start player plays a card
!!! note
    In following rounds the player with the least points will play first
- Clockwise every plays one card, obeying must follow rules
- Check who wins, winner grabs tile
    - If all cards are of led suit, highest card wins
    - If anyone played off suit, the lowest card wins
    - For ties on lowest, later played wins
- If highest card won, tile grabbed must match suit
- If lowest card won, tile can be from any suit
- If the tile shows a star, grab the topping for that flavor as well
- The round ends if a player gains their 4th tile (bust), or if everyone runs out of cards

# Scoring
- A player who won a 4th tile does not score any points
- Players who do score get one point for each ice cream tile and one point for each topping
- If a player has 10 or more points, the game ends

# New Round Setup
- Return all ice cream tiles face down and shuffle, making new stacks
- Player with the least points begins
