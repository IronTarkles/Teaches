# Overview
We're witches delivering packages for Amajon. We've got a lot of packages to deliver to meet our quota, but we don't want to hurt our backs. We've got to pace ourselves, carry the bare minumum, and pass the heavy packages off to our co-workers. The game is a play on the word Hexenschuss "shot by a witch", the german word for lumbar pain.

# Gameplay

### Pacakge card details
On the package cards (the cards we'll be playing):
- Type of cargo (the suit)
    - Black cards have no suit
- Boxes to show how heavy the package is
    - This is counted towards meeting your quota, but also towards your injuries
    - 1-3 have 3 boxes, 4-7 have 2 boxes, and 8-10 have 1 box
- A few cards have special icons
    - Cards 1-3 show `+1p`, while each six value card has a curse icon

### Quota/strength card details
On the quota/ back strength cards:
- Quota side (clipboard):
    - top half: number of packages to deliver to get bonus points
    - bottom half:
        - number of points per package in black
        - number of bonus points for hitting quota in red
- Strength side (spine):
    - package count up top
    - middle is 1p per package plus bonus points for hitting quota
    - Strength of your spine
        - Largest visible number is your current strength
        - When your strenth is reduced, spaces will get covered starting at the bottom of the gauge going upwards

### Round structure
1. Receive packages and prioritze cargo (deal cards and rank the suits)
2. Determine quota (choose bids)
3. Deliver packages (play tricks)
4. Payday and reset (score points, set up next round)

Deal out the cards, then deal out the priority row underneath the quota cards
- Priority row is 6 cards in a 4 player game and 5 cards in a 3 player game

Determine the priority
- Check for the suit with the most cards in this row (just by quantity, not value)
- Place the tokens on the priority card in order from most common to least common
- Ties are broken by the suit closest to the right side of the priority row
- The only way to have a true tie is for 2 suits to not have a card displayed in the priority row. If this happens, both tokens will be placed on the same row. Otherwise, the suits should all have different priorities

Determine quota
- Each player will draft 1 quota card for the round
- Randomly determine start player to pick first (in later rounds players choose in order from lowest score to highest)
- In the first round only, the player who picked last will score 1 point
- Flip over the quota card to show the strength gauge. In a 3 player game, use cubes to mark off the 10 and 11 spaces.
- If you have oof tokens from previous rounds, they are placed on the bottom most available space, reducing your starting strength

Card play
- The player who picked the lowest quota will be lead for the first trick, plays whatever they want
- Going clockwise, other players must follow suit if able
- To determine winner:
    - The highest priority suit wins the trick
    - If there is multiple of that suit, highest number wins
    - If there is a tie in both suit rank and number, the first card played wins the tie
- The winner must then deliver all teh cards played to that trick. 
- Count the number of boxes shown on cards, then compare the total to the winner's current strength:
    - If the total boxes are less than or equal to the current strength, they're safe. The player takes 1 normal fatigue cube and places it on the bottom available space of their strength gauge (temporarily decreasing it for the round)
    - If the total boxes are greater than the current strength, the player gets injured. They must take 1 oof token in addition to the normal fatigue cube and place both on their strength gauge (permanently decreasing it for the rest of the game)
- Whether injured or not, the winnder keeps only the card they won the trick with (boxes on the card will matter later for checking quota)
- All other cards are discarded and the winner starts the next trick

# Scoring

Whenever players have no more cards left in hand, the round ends.
- Each player scores one point for each card delivered (not boxes on card). The low cards 1-3 are worth 1 extra point each.
- Each player who met their quota exactly scores the bonus points listed on their card
    - Count the total number of boxes, not the number of cards. Missing the quota is 0 bonus points, but no penalty

### Next round setup
- Return all package cards, quota cards, fatigue tokens, and paid vacation tokens. Keep oof tokens. Check if the game is over, or start a new round
