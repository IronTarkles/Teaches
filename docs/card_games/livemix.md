## Overview

Livemix is the largest idol festival in Japan, with lots of limited time groups to see! We're producers selecting idols to perform. Will we attract fans or scare them all off?

We'll be forming a group from different idols that have different scoring conditions on them. At the end of the round, we'll be scoring those idols based on the fans that we have won over throughout the round

### Deck Makeup

- Fans: 1-12 in 4 suits
- Idols: 12 cards, 4 each of A, B, and C

### Setup

- 3 Players:
    - Remove a suit so you're playing with 36 cards

Shuffle all 12 member cards and place them in a circle in the middle of the table. Place the token under the first member put down.

Deal 12 fans to each player

## Gameplay

Each trick is made up of three phases:
- Playing cards
- Checking winner
- Leave or stay

Tricks will repeat until we've played all cards in hand, then the round ends. Game is 3 rounds.

### Playing cards

Game is must follow. Each player plays one card into the trick.

Whenever a 9 is played, the token will advance to the next member

### Checking Winner

- Highest number of the lead suit is the winner
- If a 12 and a 1 of the lead color are both played, the 1 is considered to be a 13 and wins the trick
- Winner of the trick wins all the cards and the member card where the token currently is
- Fan cards are placed face down in front of that player, with the member card played face up in front of them
- The token is then moved to the next clockwise member card

### Leave or Stay

If either of the following conditions is met, a player withdraws from the round

- In a 3 player game:
    - The player gets his or her 4th member
    - The player gains his or her 3rd member of the same group

- In a 4 player game:
    - The player gets his or her 3rd member
    - The player gets his or her 2nd member of the same group

A player who withdraws from the round keeps their hand, making sure to keep it separate from won cards. They will not participate in any further tricks this round

The player who won becomes the lead player of the next trick. If the winning player leaves the round, the next player clockwise becomes the lead.

## End of round

The round ends when all but one player has left. The remaining player gains all of his or her remaining cards in hand and all available members. All cards are placed in front of the player as if winning a trick. 

## Scoring

Players gain 1 point for each card gained that has the same color or value as specified on a member won.

One point is lost for each remaining card in hand of the same color or value as specified on a member won.

Fan cards can be scored for multiple members either way
    - If you have won over a red 5 fan, a member that wants red fans, and a member that wants 5 value fans, that is counted for both for 2 points
    - If you instead had that red 5 fan in hand and both of those members, it would be counted for both for -2 points.
