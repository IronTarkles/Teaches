# Welcome to Teaches by Tarkles
I like heavy board games, but my brain doesn't like remembering things. I write teaches for games that group things together logically to be as condensed as possible, because I hate learning a game from the rulebook.

Currently working through big games and Japanese games without english rules that I own.
