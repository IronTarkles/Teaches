We all play different familys in Florence that are accusing sinners and sending them to Hell. Once they’re in hell, we will make sure the sinners get to their correct circle of hell. The game was inspired by Dante Alighieri’s Divine Comedy

The game is played over a number of rounds that are made up of 2 phases. The Hell phase, where we move souls though the circles of hell, and the Florence phase, where we move our family members around the city above. The game will end after Dante reaches the final step on his descent into hell.
