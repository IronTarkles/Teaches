I like heavy board games, but my brain doesn't like remembering things. I write teaches for games that group things together logically to be as condensed as possible, because I hate learning a game from the rulebook.

This repo is going to be presented in material for mkdocs and will have a section for heavy game teaches, and a section for Japanese trick taking games that don't have english rules, just so I can have everything in one place.

Features to do list:
Add materials dark theme and customize
Create index structure for heavy games being under one tab, and trick takers under another
Create markdown template file to use when writing teaches in the future
